<h2>THE DESULTORY REMARKER.</h2>

<h3>No. IX.</h3>


<p>It is a fact of no infrequent occurrence,
that erroneous estimates are
formed of human conduct, and its
immediate and remote effects on the
interests of society. When this is the
case, we sometimes denounce as hostile
to social order and salutary improvement,
those who are really their
most faithful and efficient friends,
and in this way become the agents
and disseminators of error and injustice.
There is nothing perhaps, more
unfashionable, not to say mischievous,
in the eyes of the present generation,
than what they denominate <span class="smcap">Enthusiasm</span>;
a temper of mind, which they
are disposed to treat with the greatest
contempt, as altogether unworthy the
enlightened period in which we live.
If the legitimate import of the word
were always observed in its application,
there would be little controversy
on the subject; as no one would
become the advocate of "vain imaginations"
or "violent passions." But it
is believed that much that is truly valuable
in its character and tendency, is
improperly ascribed to this source;
by which hostile prejudices are excited,
in opposition to that which is
entitled to the countenance and support
of the public.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Charles J. Fox's</span> history of
<span class="smcap">James II.</span> there is this passage:&mdash;"We
are accused of enthusiasm!
are we then fanaticks? Are we enthusiasts
because we do not rob&mdash;abstain
from murder? If by enthusiasm
be meant <em>zeal and warmth</em>, I
freely acknowledge it; I glory in it.
Enthusiasm, when it arises out of <em>a
just cause</em>, is that which makes men
act in it with energy; it is that, without
which <em>nothing was ever done
great, since the creation of the world</em>.
Enthusiasm of this sort, I hope, therefore,
I shall always possess." The
historian referred to, will not be
classed among credulous, weak-minded
men; for he was one of the most
eminent statesmen of his day; and
his opinion is therefore justly considered
as authoritative. The position
taken, is corroborated by all experience,
that great actions and great
achievements are never the result of
lukewarmness and indifference; but
of "zeal and warmth," directed to
"a good cause," without which honourable
and permanent distinction
can never be obtained. What is too
frequently mistaken for enthusiasm,
is in reality produced by a profound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
conviction of the truth, in connection
with some particular object, of the
greatest importance to mankind.</p>

<p>It was this that guided <span class="smcap">Columbus</span>
across the unknown and boisterous
ocean, and opened to his view a new
world; which enabled him to encounter
and surmount every difficulty,
which the malice of his enemies, or
the combination of untoward circumstances,
arrayed against his great design;
a design which was branded as
a chimera of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>It was this which induced <span class="smcap">Franklin</span>
to persevere in his philosophical
experiments, until they were crowned
with success; and the identity of lightning
and the electric fluid, completely
established, and eventually placed his
name among the most eminent philosophers
of the age.</p>

<p>It was this, that enabled <span class="smcap">Rittenhouse</span>
to emerge from the condition
of an humble mechanic in Montgomery
county, and by the construction
of his wonderful Orrery, to obtain
from Jefferson this great but well-merited
testimony to his talents;&mdash;"that
no mortal was ever permitted to make
so near an approach to his Creator."</p>

<p>It was this that strengthened the
hands of the immortal <span class="smcap">FOUNDER</span> of
Pennsylvania, in his noble determination
of sacrificing the bright prospects
which birth and connexions imparted,
to a sense of duty; and of
establishing an asylum in a remote
wilderness, where the oppressed of all
nations, kindred, and people, might
find a covert from the storm of civil
and religious persecution, and enjoy
in perfect security the sacred rights
of conscience.</p>

<p>It was this which guided the footsteps
of <span class="smcap">Howard</span> to the distant abodes
of wretchedness and wo, unmindful
of the comforts and delights of home,
to bind up the sorrows of their miserable
tenants, and to complete, in the
language of Burke, his "noble circumnavigation
of charity."</p>

<p>It was this which conducted <span class="smcap">Fulton</span>
to that astonishing result, justly
considered as the great wonder of the
age&mdash;<em>navigation by steam</em>; after a
crowd of discouragements and difficulties
had been subdued, sufficient
to disconcert the plans and defeat
the object of almost any other man,
however sanguine his temper and resolute
his purpose.</p>

<p>It was this which under Providence
induced that signal victory, obtained
in Great Britain, by <span class="smcap">Sharp</span>, <span class="smcap">Wilberforce</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Clarkson</span>, over the disgrace
of humanity and civilization,
the <span class="smcap">SLAVE-TRADE</span>; after a most doubtful
and arduous conflict of more than
twenty years, with avarice and oppression.</p>

<p>To conclude, nothing but this active
and persevering zeal, will, <em>in
future</em>, lead to like glorious results.
Instead, therefore, of its being opprobriously
branded, let it be cherished,
when directed to just and important
objects, as a prolific source of good
to man. Scientific research has an
ample field before her still unexplored,
in which no doubt laurels
will continue to be reaped, and great
and substantial advantages be derived
by new discoveries. But the <em>moral
improvement</em> of our fellow citizens,
should be sedulously attended to, as
more immediately soliciting our notice;
and the cause of such of them
as are denied the rights to which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
are by nature entitled, should be fearlessly
and constantly vindicated, as
truth and justice may open the way;
notwithstanding those may be denounced
as <span class="smcap">ENTHUSIASTS</span>, who believe
that in the eye of the great Creator,
"<span class="smcap">ALL MEN ARE EQUAL</span>."      ☞</p>

<h2>VARIETY.</h2>

<p class="center">For the Rural Magazine.</p>


<p>The fogs of England have been at
all times the complaint of foreigners.
Gondomar the Spanish ambassador,
when some one who was going to
Spain waited on him to ask whether
he had any commands, replied, "Only
my compliments to the Sun, whom
I have not seen since I came to England."
Caracoli, the Neapolitan minister
there, a man of a good deal of
conversational wit, used to say that
the only ripe fruit he had seen in
England, were roasted apples; and
in a conversation with George II., he
took the liberty of preferring the
Moon of Naples to the Sun of England.</p>


<h3>JOHN HOWARD.</h3>

<p>I have been frequently asked, says
this great man, what precautions I
use to preserve myself from infections
in the prisons and hospitals I
visit. I here answer, next to the free
goodness and mercy of the Author of
my being, temperance and cleanliness
are my preservatives. Trusting in
Divine Providence, and believing myself
in the way of my duty, I visit the
most noxious cells, and while thus
employed, "I fear no evil."</p>


<h3>FRANKLIN.</h3>

<p>He that raises a large family, says
Franklin, does indeed, while he lives
to observe them, <em>stand</em>, as Watts says,
<em>a broader mark for sorrow</em>; but then
he stands a broader mark for pleasure
too. When we launch our little fleet
of barks into the ocean, bound to different
ports, we hope for each, a
prosperous voyage; but contrary
winds, hidden shoals, storms and enemies,
come in for a share in the disposition
of events; and though these
occasion a mixture of disappointment,
yet considering the risk where we can
make no insurance, we should think
ourselves happy if some return with
success.</p>


<h3>BURNS THE POET.</h3>

<p>About the age of thirteen, Burns
was sent during a part of the summer
to the parish school in Dalrymple, in
order to improve his hand writing.&mdash;In
the following year he had an opportunity
of passing several weeks
with his old friend Murdoch, with
whose assistance he began to study
French with intense ardour and assiduity.
His proficiency in that language,
though it was wonderful, considering
his opportunities, was necessarily
slight; yet it was in shewing
this accomplishment alone that Burns'
weakness ever took the shape of vanity.
One of his friends, who carried
him into the company of a French
lady, remarked with surprise that he
attempted to converse with her in her
own tongue. Their French, however,
was soon found to be almost mutually
unintelligible. As far as Burns could
make himself understood, he unfortunately
offended the foreign lady.&mdash;He
meant to tell her that she was a
charming person and delightful in conversation;
but expressed himself so
as to appear to her to mean, that she
was fond of speaking; to which the
Gallic dame indignantly replied, that
it was quite as common for poets to
be impertinent, as for women to be
loquacious.</p>

<h2>INDIAN CORN: ITS BAD AND GOOD
CULTURE.</h2>


<p>An agricultural traveller, who has
recently passed through parts of
Montgomery, Berks, Lehigh, Northampton
and Philadelphia counties,
by the great roads leading through
them, wishes, most cordially and earnestly
to call the attention of the
farmers to their unfortunate style of
agriculture in some important particulars.</p>

<p>After leaving the neighbourhood
of Norristown, with a few exceptions,
a barely tolerable field of Indian corn
was rarely to be seen, until he arrived,
on his return from Easton, into
the southern parts of Bucks county.
The foes to all good husbandry, weeds,
were predominant in almost every
cornfield. If, perchance, the interior
was tolerably clear, a circumstance
which rarely, occurred, the weeds
around the enclosures were so lamentably
abundant, that the corn was, in
a great degree, obscured. Good and
bad land exhibited the like ruinous
and disgusting appearance and miserable
promise; and the same bad system
of culture prevailed. The ploughing
was generally shallow, whatever
might be the texture of the soil.&mdash;Every
field was ridged; many had
been broken up in bulks, and furrows
were always thrown up to the plants,
for the drought to turn into dust, or
indurate into impenetrable clods.&mdash;The
middle spaces between the rows
were untouched, either by the plough
or the harrow in very numerous instances.
Countless varieties of pestiferous
coarse grasses and weeds took
possession of these neglected spots,
furnishing a counterbalance to any
supplies from the earth or the air,
which the corn plants, in the absence
of these pests, might have drawn, and
effectually preventing the extension
of their roots beyond the bounds of
the elevated furrows, or narrow ridges,
in which they were imprisoned. Can
it then be wondered at, that the crops
evidenced a sickly, stunted &amp; wretched
appearance, both in colour and size?
In some fields, where limestone prevailed,
and, perhaps, lime had been
applied, the colour was better, but
the weeds and grasses abundant;
on the head lands particularly, which
are seldom sufficiently, if at all,
stirred and cleaned: thus establishing
a mischievous nursery of poisonous
pests to perpetuate their
scourges on future crops. Fall
ploughing was rarely, if at all, practised;
and lime little used, even in
many limestone districts. One farmer
said, "their land was hot enough
without lime." It is hoped, that this
superlative ignorance of the qualities
of lime, which, when slacked, is the
coldest of all substances applied to
land, is confined to the individual
sporting the opinion. One of the uses
of lime is to supply the soil, and that
not too lavishly, with calcareous matter,
when its caustic qualities are subdued.</p>

<p>This is not exaggerated, but is a
regretful picture. It is held up to
intelligent and well-disposed farmers,
who, by viewing its deformities, may
banish entirely their present mode of
culture, which, by its own showing, is
proved to be radically wrong. A corn
crop is not only in itself, but, when
well cultivated, is in its consequences
the most valuable of all our products.
With an abhorrence of weeds, the
test of intelligence in a farmer, he
can, with a corn crop, more effectually
clean and prepare his fields for
succeeding crops, than can be done
by any other culture. Whilst he is
attending his corn, which will not,
with impunity, suffer neglect, he is
not only invigorating and increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
his crop, but he is subduing his worst
enemies&mdash;weeds of all kinds. This
makes ample amends for the exhaustion
of the soil by this gigantic
plant.</p>

<p>The change recommended, is dictated
not only by reasonable theory,
but is founded on long experience
and multitudinous practical proofs.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Deep and Flat Culture.</i></p>

<p>Plough your fields throughout
<em>deeply</em>; and <em>that</em> in the fall, to expose
and destroy the eggs of the grub moth;
and roll, to pulverize the clods. Harrow
in lime at this season, or on spring
ploughed ground, for corn; and do
not spread it on your fallows for
wheat; because it is then injurious to
your winter grain crop; as frequent
experience has shown. Mark out
your squares or drills, lightly, with
the plough; and thereafter never
suffer the plough to enter your fields.
Work entirely with <em>harrows</em>; whereof
procure the necessary variety;
some with large, and others with
smaller <em>hoes</em>. These cut up weeds,
and sufficiently stir your intervals to
any depth you choose. If the hand
hoes be found indispensable, use them
near your plants; but never hill or
plough up furrows. The common
harrow will have its share of usefulness;
and spare it not. As often as
young weeds appear, or your surface
becomes crusty, often occasioned by
drought after rains, ply the harrows.
You will then have a deep, loose and
light body of pulverized soil, for your
roots to penetrate. It will imbibe
the dews and gases from the atmosphere;
and afford, in the severest
droughts, perpetual moisture and
nourishment; which will be exclusively
applied to your corn plant;
having no robbers to contend with.
In droughts, deeply stirred soil inhales
and <em>retains</em> moisture. In wet seasons
it is the least injured; because it affords
room for superabundant wetness.
Being elastic and buoyant, it
does not consolidate or settle into concrete
bodies, like shallow ploughed,
cloddy, and unstirred ground. The
corn roots (which have, in such
ground, been measured ten feet long,)
will have a continuous and not a divided
soil, wherein to expand and extend
themselves; in which, it being
loose, deep, and constantly moist, the
roots will far exceed those confined
to narrow detached ridges, wherein
they are short and starved. It is an
idle opinion, to suppose that plants
spend themselves in roots. The
stronger, the root, the more vigorous
is the plant.</p>

<p>If you <em>will</em> introduce the plough
after the first breaking up, either before
or after planting; and squares
are the most commodious for thorough
stirring and cleaning; plough shallow;
so as not to disturb the deeply
buried sod. Let the harrows level
and flatten your surface at the next
operation; and continue them exclusively
in all future stirrings. Your
culture will be easier, cheaper, and
more abundantly profitable, than those
who are accustomed to the old modes
will <em>believe</em>, until they <em>see</em>.</p>

<p>If your field requires drains, draw
furrows in proper places. If it be
naturally wet, break up deeply in very
broad lands, on which the harrows
may still be used, and drains sufficiently
multiplied. If it be stony,
rugged, or harsh, either plant other
crops; or strengthen your harrows;
ridged ground dries the soonest, and
burns through; so does all shallow
ploughed soil, whether ridged or flat.
Attraction of moisture is trifling, and
evaporation rapid.</p>

<p>Be not afraid of cutting corn roots,
which benefit by excision; throwing
out, on the parts attached to the plants,
numerous fibres, to draw in and communicate
their food.</p>

<p>Your corn, in deeply ploughed and
frequently stirred ground, will resist
storms and heavy rains, owing to the
strength and numbers of its roots, far
beyond hilled or ridged plants. If it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
yields to the storm, and leans, the extent,
tenacity, and re-acting contraction
of the roots, will generally restore
the erect position of the stalks: whereas,
in the ridged or hill culture, the
roots are short, brittle, and incapable
of recovery. It is not uncommon in
the deep and flat culture, for those
called finger roots, to grow entirely
or greatly extended <em>under</em> instead of
<em>above</em> the surface; and throw out innumerable
fibres, to support the
stalk.</p>

<p>Detach all suckers, which are robbers;
and top, in due season, to shorten
the lever, insure the standing of the
stalks, and facilitate the ripening of
the grains.</p>

<p>Banish all apprehensions, that working
among corn in dry weather, is injurious.
The contrary is the truth;
for your harrows will, in such weather,
have the double effect of more
certainly destroying weeds, and pulverizing,
to open mouths to take in
moisture and gases, from the dews
and the air.</p>

<p>It being seldom practised in Pennsylvania,
I need not warn you against
sowing winter grain in the same year
with corn. This not only scourges
your land, but interferes with the great
use of the cleaning culture, affording
the time and opportunity for weeds
to recover their pestiferous reign, and
is a sure test of slovenly and covetous
farming.</p>

<p>If you will not at once believe in
this system of corn husbandry, now
frequently and ever successfully practised,
where the best crops are to be
seen, try a small portion of your field&mdash;do
it justice&mdash;and compare it with
the old mode, for your own and your
neighbour's conviction. Whatever
may be hastily thought of these observations,
they are, with the most
friendly wishes for their prosperity,
offered for the serious consideration
of liberal minded and unprejudiced
farmers; among whom numberless
instances of good farming, in other
respects, are to be found, and to which
the greatest proportion of the corn
culture is a mortifying contrast.</p>

enact:</p>

<p>"That as soon as the Board of
Commissioners and two-thirds of the
Grand Jury, of any county within this
Commonwealth, shall agree, in writing
under their respective hands
(which agreement shall be filed in the
office of the Prothonotary of the proper
county) that a society shall be established
within the same; then it
shall and may be lawful for twenty
or more inhabitants of any such
county, fifteen of whom shall be practical
and actual farmers, under the
name of The Society for the Promotion
of Agriculture and Domestic
Manufactures, in and for such county,
to sign an agreement, promising
to pay the treasurer of said society,
so long as he shall remain a member
thereof, the sum of one dollar each,
or more, annually, for the purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
hereinafter mentioned, and cause such
agreement to be filed in the office of
the Prothonotary of proper county;
every such society shall by virtue of
this act become a body politic and
corporate, in deed and in law, with
perpetual succession, and all the
rights, liberties, privileges, and franchises
incident to a corporation, for
all the purposes of this act, and to
admit new members upon the terms
aforesaid. <i>Provided</i>, That the association
which shall have first filed their
articles of agreement shall be the only
one entitled to the privileges granted
by this act.</p>

<p>"That the said societies, respectively,
shall meet at some convenient
place on the Wednesday of the next
Court of Common Pleas, after the
said agreements shall have been filed
as aforesaid, and choose by a majority
of votes, out of their number, one
president, ten directors, one treasurer,
and one secretary, who shall be officers
of said society for one year and
until others are duly elected. And
the said societies respectively, at their
first meeting, shall have power to fix
on the time and place of their annual

they shall designate, which shall continue
to be the day of the annual
meeting of the societies respectively,
until otherwise altered by a vote of
the members as aforesaid; and also
to make their own rules and by-laws,
not inconsistent with the constitution
and laws of the United States, or of
this state; and to add other officers
to those designated, and prescribe
their respective duties. And the president
and directors shall have power

county rates and levies, after said societies
respectively shall have been
established and organized in any county
within this commonwealth, and annually
thereafter, the county commissioners
are hereby required to assess,

<p>I need not read the remaining sections
of this law. The pamphlet
containing it will be laid upon your
table, and you will have an opportunity
of deliberately considering it in
all its parts.</p>

<p>I wish to impress you, gentlemen,
with the importance of this subject,
as it affects the vital interests of our
country; particularly at a time when
our foreign markets are almost destroyed,
and we must learn to establish
our prosperity on the interchange
of commodities within our
own limits. This will produce a solid
independence, teach us the value of
our connexions with one another, and
bind us in bonds of mutual interest.
The struggle has heretofore been
(and a fatal one it has proved) to get
<em>rich</em>: the endeavour now must be,
how to <em>live</em> in comfort and plenty.</p>

<p>The consumption and use of the
necessaries and conveniences of life,
by 10,000,000 of people, and the demands
for the materials of domestic
manufactures, cannot fail to afford
to every quarter of our Union the
means of substantial enjoyment. <em>Industry</em>
must take the place of hazardous
<em>Speculation</em>, and <em>Frugality</em>
must succeed <em>Extravagance</em>. We
shall then be taught to live within
our means, and this will easily be accomplished,
when we have only real
wants, and not those which are, for
the most part, artificial and fanciful.
We must "eat our bread in the sweat
of our faces," and we shall find it the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
sweetest and most nutritive of any
food we have heretofore enjoyed. It
may not be accompanied by luxurious
and expensive viands; but its associates
will be health, peace of mind,
and corporeal vigour, ensuring exemplary
life and purity of morals.</p>

<p>The foundation of the public prosperity
is undoubtedly agriculture.
This brings forth all the materials
about which other branches of labour
are, for the most part, employed, and
sustains the workers in every department
of the mechanic arts, in their
labours. Without it, the earth would
be a howling desert: with it, the cultivated
world is an artificial Paradise,
produced by the labour of Man, who,
being doomed to "eat his bread in the
sweat of his face," thus fulfils the decrees
of Heaven, while he ensures to
himself and his race the blessings of
plenty, innocence and health. To what
a high destiny, then, is the farmer appointed,
when to him is committed the
art on which the subsistence of his fellow
men necessarily depends. His responsibilities
are great indeed; and
shall he rely only on his individual
efforts and limited experience, for
the fulfilment of such important duties?
No: he should call to his aid
the experience, the intelligence, and
the scientific as well as practical
knowledge, which associations for
promoting agriculture are universally
found to afford, and thereby add to
his own, the experience of those with
whom he is associated, and, by joint
efforts, produce results to which any
one individual is incompetent. The
practices, good or bad, which are
handed down by his predecessors, are
repeated; and little progress is made
in improvement by isolated or self-confident
individuals.</p>

<p>It would be a toilsome task, nor indeed
would my limited information
enable me, to enumerate all the discoveries
and improvements in husbandry
which modern times have developed.
I will mention one or two of
the most prominent. There have been
but few articles used among our farmers,
for the most essential of all requisites,
<em>manuring their lands</em>. <em>Dung</em>,
which can be produced only in quantities
inadequate to the demand for
it, has been the universal and main
reliance, <em>Lime</em> is also generally esteemed
of primary importance. Both
of these are estimable, without dispute;
and yet it is now well known
in Europe, and begins to be so here,
that <em>the ashes of burnt clay</em> constitute
a manure which is superiour to
them all, for every purpose to which
they have been applied. Clay is
found every where in immense quantities,
and can be cheaply converted
into ashes, and whole farms may be
rapidly fertilized in place of partial
and protracted applications of more
expensive and less attainable manures;
it is fortunately best adapted
for strong and clay soils, which thus
afford renovations of their surfaces out
of their own bowels. This account
of so valuable an addition to our stock
of manure, obtained from a material
of little estimation, walked over every
day, and heedlessly neglected, will
not, perhaps, be believed by the generality
of our farmers; and yet the
most celebrated agriculturists in England,
Scotland, and Ireland are so
convinced of the fact, from actual experience,
that it is maintained to be
"the most important discovery in
agriculture which modern times have
produced."</p>

<p>The application of salt to our fields
as manure, is now under very extensive
experiment. There is no doubt
of its efficacy: but it requires experience,
as to quantity per acre, and
the kinds of soil the most suitable.
This is not a new discovery; for its
application to <em>land as manure</em> has
been known before, and at the time
of, our blessed Saviour's appearance
upon earth. In St. Luke's
Gospel<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> it is said, "<em>salt</em> is good; but
if the salt has lost its savour, wherewith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
shall it be seasoned? It is neither
<em>fit for the land</em> nor <em>yet for the
dunghill</em>; but men cast it out." Its
uses, both for cattle and manure, can
be traced through the writings of the
most eminent among the <em>Romans</em>,
down to the most celebrated chymists
and agriculturists of our own day.
Where are our farmers to learn such
facts and discoveries? Not of themselves;
for there are many who do
not read, and few go out of their way
to try experiments. They can only
be taught by agricultural associations,
wherein the experience of practical
farmers, the information derived from
books, and the assistance of scientific
characters, are happily combined.</p>

<p>The spirit for agricultural improvement,
and the formation of societies,
has very much spread throughout
the Union. Shall Pennsylvania
be behind her sister states in such
associations? She is before them in
many practical proofs of her good
husbandry; but has yet much to learn.
Let us then promptly obey the call
of our legislature, and begin the great
work by forming societies and rendering
them efficient. Let us pride
ourselves in our household manufactures;
and for this purpose let us invite
the female branches of our families
to join in our plan. <em>Without their
aid</em>, we can do nothing in such manufactures;
<em>with it</em>, everything. Instead
of foreign gewgaws and expensive
finery, we may be independent
in articles for household uses and our
attire, and save the expenditures which
now go into the pockets of foreigners.
Commerce is certainly essential
to an agricultural country; but the
extent of it should be no greater than
our products will reach: when the
balance turns against us, our prosperity
declines.</p>

<p>You know, gentlemen, that our
farmers will be satisfied only by actual
observations of practical proofs.
We must have public manifestations
of improvement. The institution of
cattle-shows should be promoted.
They would be useful as places of
sale, or for the exhibition of the best
breeds, or for exposing for imitation
or sale the best and greatest variety
of household manufacture. On these
occasions, premiums, more honorary
than costly, should be distributed to
successful candidates, either for such
cattle or manufactures, or for agricultural
discoveries or improvements,
or the best execution of known practices.
Emulation must be roused and
encouraged, and the honourable pride
of excelling must be fostered. Such
public exhibitions must be conducted
by discreet and reputable men.</p>

<p>Under such guidance and with
suitable accompaniments of innocent
pleasure and amusement, they will
make a much stronger impression
than any oral addresses or written
communications. By these exhibitions,
the emulation, excited in some
neighbouring states has improved
their agriculture and increased their
manufactures to a degree almost incredible.
Agricultural societies are
extending to every quarter of the
Union. Until very lately, there did
not exist one to the southward of
Pennsylvania, and she had but two,
<em>to wit</em>, the Philadelphia Society, which
has long continued its useful labours
and eminent zeal; and that of Blockley
and Merior, in the neighbourhood
of Philadelphia. In the Eastern States,
they are numerous; and in New York,
forty or fifty are recently formed and
are making successful progress.</p>

<p>I shall not enlarge further upon
these topics, but will dismiss you
with the expression of a hope that
you may be governed in all your deliberations
by the pure principles of justice;
that by preserving your minds
entirely free from hate, from friendship,
from anger, and from pity, they
may be directed to such conclusions
as may best effectuate the great purposes
for which you are assembled,
and that in clearing the innocent from
unjust suspicion, and dragging the
guilty to deserved punishment, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
may promote the best interests of society,
and secure the freedom and happiness
of its individual members.</p>

<h2>LETTERS ON AGRICULTURE.</h2>

<p class="center">(Concluded from last Number.)</p>


<p>Though the cultivation of land by
metayers may be unfavourable to its
amelioration, still it may be easily
imagined, that the smaller products
of every little farm will be greater,
as each must possess both a garden
and a poultry yard. Every field in
Lombardy is encircled with a band of
poplars, mulberries, oaks, &amp;c., and
they are often so thick that the eye
can scarcely penetrate the rich growth
of leaves. From the boughs, luxuriant
vines hang in festoons, and present
to the passing traveller a scene of rural
beauty and enjoyment which he
may search for in vain in other countries.
The shade of the trees does
not injure the crops, such is the invigorating
effect of a humid soil and
an Italian sky.</p>

<p>Of the constant succession of crops
we here know very little; indeed it
is the result of experience alone. So
much depends on climate, that we
imagine the rotation practised elsewhere
can never afford certain information
to us. The largest quantity
of the most valuable product, which
may be taken from a spot of ground
in any number of years, is a problem
whose solution is of the greatest importance.
In Piedmont the rotation
is generally as follow:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
1st year, Indian corn, manured, Beans&mdash;hemp.</p>

<p>2d year, Wheat.</p>

<p>3d year, Clover, turned up after the first cutting and fallowed by a fallow.</p>

<p>4th year, Wheat.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>This rotation, says M. de Chateauvieux,
is one of the most abundant,
and may be pursued indefinitely, notwithstanding
the recurrence of wheat,
though perhaps the result may be atributed
to the abundance of manure
furnished by a meadow cut three
times. After stating that a farm of
sixty arpents supported a family of
eight or nine persons, who kept twenty-two
head of large cattle, of which
two oxen and a cow are fattened every
year, as well as one or two hogs,
that it gave about one hundred and
twenty-five dollars worth of silk, and
furnished more wine than could be
consumed, that the preparatory crop
of Indian corn and beans almost subsisted
the metayers, and that nearly
all the grain might be sold, as well
as a great quantity of smaller products,
he celebrates the industry and
management of the Piedmontese proprietors
in the following terms: 'It
will be easy for you, after this, to conceive
how Piedmont is perhaps, of all
countries, that where the economy
and management of land is best understood,
and the phenomenon of its
great population and immense exportation
of produce will thus be explained.'</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Placenza,
cattle rather than grain constitute the
wealth of the farmer. The cows and
oxen are distinguished by immense
horns and beautiful figures, and we
believe that our American race is in
no way to be compared with them.&mdash;Their
origin is said to be Hungarian;
the males are noble animals, but the
cows give little milk. To remedy
this inconvenience, two thousand cows
are imported from Switzerland, and
the valuable qualities of the animal
are thus perpetuated. The cattle are
almost universally of a slate-grey colour.
The rotation of crops is here
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1st year, Indian corn and hemp, manured.</p>

<p>2d year, Wheat.</p>

<p>3d year, Winter beans.</p>

<p>4th year, Wheat, manured.</p>

<p>5th year, Clover, ploughed after the first cutting.</p>

<p>6th year, Wheat.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>This succession, however, can only
be pursued in a rich soil, which is
manured every three years. There
is one article we beg leave to notice
particularly. We imagine that the
winter bean might easily be introduced
among us, and with great advantage,
as it is capable of supporting
the cold of the severest winter.
It is sown in the beginning of September,
and it must have considerable
growth before autumn to resist
the attacks of the cold. The stalk
then perishes by the frost, but at the
moment the genial warmth of the
spring is felt, two or three new stalks
arise, which bloom in the month of
May, and the beans are fit to gather
at the end of July. The management
of this important vegetable we
give in the words of the author. 'La
culture est extrêmement simple;
aprés a récolte du blé fumé, on retourne
la terre par un seul labour et
on la laisse émietter par l'influence
de la saison. Aux premiers jours de
Septembre on séme les féves, soit en
les enterrant á la charrue, soit en les
recoverant á la herse, soit enfin avec
le semoire, qui les place par rangées,
de manière à pouvoir au printemps
les sarcler avec la houe à cheval. Si
on ne suit pas cette dernière méthode,
il faut les sarcler à la main, dans le
courant d'avril.' The culture of the
winter bean is suited to argillaceous
soils, and while it allows the proper
intervals between ploughing the
ground and sowing wheat which succeeds,
it is admirably calculated to
maintain the fertility of the ground.</p>

<p>The plains which border on the Po,
in the vicinity of Parma and Lodi,
support those fine animals, whose
milk is converted into the celebrated
Parmesan cheese. The grass is
here far more valuable than any crop
of grain. In the summer the cows
are housed and fed with the green
grass of the first and second mowings:
that of the third is converted into hay.
At the end of autumn the cows are
allowed to pick up whatever may be
left in the fields. These meadows
are perhaps the most fertile on earth;
they are generally mowed four times
a year. The cheese is here never
made from less than fifty cows, and as
the farms are small, there is one common
establishment, to which the milk
is brought twice during the day; an
account of it is kept by the cheesemaker
and settled in cheese every
six months. The same plan has been
introduced in Switzerland.</p>

<p>In the Milanese, the farms are
larger than in other parts of Italy, because
the culture of the grasses demands
less care and labour than other
branches of farming, and fewer advances.
Irrigation is here carried to
such an extent, that every two or
three arpents can be inundated by its
own canal. The good quality of the
grass, however, in time becomes deteriorated,
other plants gradually
spring up in the place of the grasses;
the sluices are then closed, and the
ground is ploughed for hemp; after
which, and a crop of legumes, oats,
and wheat, it is again laid down in
grass. A meadow will generally last
fifteen years, and the course of harvests
returns every five. M. de Chateauvieux
gives the following remarkable
outline:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1st year, Hemp, followed by legumes.</p>
<p>2d year, Oats.</p>
<p>3d year, Wheat, followed by legumes.</p>
<p>4th year, Indian corn.</p>
<p>5th year, Wheat.</p>
<p>15th year, Natural meadow, dunged every 3 years, and mowed 4 times a year.</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>20 years 67</p>
<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>Of these sixty-seven crops from the
same ground there are sixty-one for
the use of animals, five for the sustenance
of man, and only one for his
clothing. There is, perhaps, no
country on the face of the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
which can boast such a proportion
of agricultural products. To obtain
this result, the ground is manured,
very profusely however, five times
in twenty years, and it is a singular
fact that this manure is applied
always to the grass and never to the
grain.</p>

<p>The culture of rice occupies a
part of Italy, and is a source of great
profit to the owner of the soil. The
difficulties in its cultivation are so trifling,
that, contrary to the usual custom,
the ground is let out at a fixed
rent of one hundred and sixty francs
the arpent; three crops are received
every five years. As with us, these
rice grounds are most unhealthy, and
the stagnant water which covers them
produces disease in all the surrounding
country. The unfortunate peasant
rarely escapes its deleterious effect,
and the government, sensible of
this constant draft on human life, have
prohibited the further extension of
the culture of this grain.</p>

<p>One of the most singular features
in the physical character of Italy, is
the constant elevation of the beds of
rivers, particularly the Arno and the
Po, by means of depositions of earth
and stones, brought down by the
heavy rains from the mountains.&mdash;This
had become so alarming, that
the raising of dykes yielded to a very
ingenious operation called <em>Colmata</em>,
by which the water of the river was
allowed to overflow a certain space,
and this very deposition, about three
or four inches in a year, made to raise
the level of the adjacent shores. But
this process, which is fully described
by Sismondi, must necessarily have a
limit. Embankments are resorted to,
and in some places the bed of the Po
is absolutely thirty feet above the level
country. The Po even now frequently
overflows and devastates its
banks; the inhabitants, provided always
for the calamity which unfortunately
is not unfrequent, take to their
boats and wait till the inundation has
subsided. There would seem to be
little doubt that at some day not far
distant, the whole delta of the Po, or
<em>Polesino</em>, as it is called, will become
one wide and wretched marsh. Even
now the roads are often impassable.
Ferara, consecrated by the genius of
Ariosto and Tasso, will be extinguished,
and Revenna, already fallen
from its high honours, be known only
as the deserted capital of a potentate
of the lower empire.</p>

<p>M. de Chateauvieux, climbing the
mountains which separate Tuscany
from Modena, and leaving behind
him the fertile plains of Lombardy,
entered those lofty regions, where the
earth does not produce sufficient sustenance
for the inhabitants, who are
employed with their flocks of goats
and sheep, in constantly traversing
the mountains in a manner somewhat
similar to that of the Spanish shepherds.
The author employs himself
in describing the scenery of the Corniche,
and though it is perhaps among
the finest in Europe, and he might
have felt all its changeful beauty and
sublimity, still we think he is far
more fortunate in his delineations of
rural economy.</p>

<p>The agriculture of Tuscany has
been so fully and ably investigated by
Sismondi,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that little was left to M.
de Chateauvieux. The valley of the
Arno, in truth the only fertile part of
the dukedom, (for the rest is composed
of precipitous mountains, or that
silent and hideous district the Maremma)
stretches from Cortona to Pisa,
and forms about one-sixth of its whole
territory. The farms are very small,
being from three to six arpents, so
that one pair of oxen supplies the necessities
of ten or twelve metayers, in
the working of their little plat of
ground. They manifest, however,
their extravagance in maintaining a
horse, which may transport their produce
to market, and their wives and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
daughters to mass or a rustic ball.&mdash;The
most general rotation of crops is
here:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1st year, Indian corn, beans, peas, or other legumes dunged.</p>

<p>2d year,   Wheat.</p>

<p>3d year,   Winter beans.</p>

<p>4th year,  Wheat.</p>

<p>5th year, Clover, sown after the wheat, cut in the spring and followed by <em>sorgho</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>This <em>sorgho</em> is a sort of parsnip,
which is reduced into flour, of which
they make a bad soup and a poor polente.
The ground is manured only
once in five years, a circumstance
which abundantly proves the richness
of this deep alluvial soil. Notwithstanding
all this fertility and a cultivation
which resembles rather that of a
garden, than a farm, the country does
not produce enough to resist the effects
of a bad year. The metayers
live with the greatest economy, and
though their cottages are built with a
taste which seems indigenous to the
country, the interior exhibits a total
absence of all the conveniences of
life, and supplies but a frugal subsistence.
Such is the view which M. de
Chateauvieux has taken. But in our
opinion the peasantry of Tuscany under
all circumstances, are not only
more neat in their persons, but better
clothed, and apparently enjoying
more happiness, than that of any
other district in Italy. There can
be little doubt, that all this distress
and privation arises from the system
of the metayers; a system which, deriving
its existence from the feudal
state, is equally to be deprecated,
whether we consider the political
character of the community or the
individual happiness of its members.
The man who has no other possession
than his industry, and who cannot
hope to change his situation, can
never have such a stake in the state,
as to render him either an intelligent
or valuable member of it. On the
other hand, the metayer, bound to
furnish half the seed and to divide
and sell the produce, pretty generally
consumes one year the fruits of the
last; or if there be a surplus, how is
it to be invested? There would seem
to be no other mode, than in the sticks
which he is bound to supply, for the
support of the vines, for the landlord
provides the stock and repairs the
house. He then can only lay up his
money in his chest, or spend it on his
pleasures. Thus the end of a year
finds him no better off than at its
commencement, for want of such an
interest in the soil, as would secure
him from the effects of his negligence
and indifference in its cultivation.</p>

<p>Before leaving this part of Italy,
we ought to mention a subject which
is of some little importance; the manufacture
of straw hats, which has
just commenced in our country. It
is doubtless a most profitable exertion
of industry. The raw material
costs nothing, and M. de Chateauvieux
informs us that this branch annually
amounts to three millions (we
presume) of francs. The straw is of
beardless wheat, cut before it is ripe,
and whose vegetation has been thinned
(étiolée) by the sterility of the
soil. This soil is chosen among calcareous
hills; it is never manured,
and the grain is sown very thick.
The women who are employed in
making the Leghorn hats, earn from
about thirty to forty cents per day,
no trifling sum in Italy.</p>

<p>The Maremma or country of the
Malaria forms the third district, extending
from Leghorn to Terracina,
and from the sea to the mountains,
and having a width of twenty-five or
thirty miles. M. de Chateauvieux
speaks of this singular country in the
following terms: 'Le ciel reste également
pur, la verdure aussi fraiche,

respirant cet air à la fois si suave et
si funeste.' A country so very singular
in its character would necessarily
require a very peculiar system of
management. Our author developes
this system in a visit he made to a
domain called Campo Morto, in the
most deserted part of the Maremma.
Here was a Faltore, charged with
the administration of the farm. The
whole Maremma of Rome is in the
hands of eighty proprietors, who are
called mercanti de' tenuti, and reside
as well as their Fattori in the city.&mdash;On
this farm there were four hundred
horses, of which, one hundred
were broken; two thousand hogs,
which ran in the woods and fed on
the acorns; some hundreds of cows,
who give no other revenue than the
sale of the calves, which is estimated
at about eight dollars each cow; one
hundred oxen used to the plough, and
about four thousand sheep. The rent
of this farm was about eighteen francs
the arpent of cultivated land, amounting
in all to about $22,000. The annual
profit was about $5000, besides
interest at five per cent. on the capital
of the flocks.</p>

<p>In the midst of this establishment
there was a vast <em>casale</em> or farm house,
destitute of furniture and inhabited
but a very few days in the year.&mdash;Every
thing around breathed the
most perfect desolation; all was vast
and silent. The harvest had just commenced
and a thousand labourers, of
whom one half were women, had descended
from the mountains to gain a
small pittance during a few days, by
reaping the rich grain of six hundred
and sixty arpents for the lordly proprietor,
and if they did not perish at
their toil, to go back after having respired
the elements of a miserable
death. Some days had elapsed since
the harvest began, and only two labourers
had been attacked by the fever
of the Malaria; every day would,
however, increase the number, till at
the completion of their task, scarcely
half of them would remain. 'What
then becomes of these unfortunate
people?' said M. de Chateauvieux.
'They get a piece of bread and are
sent off,' was the inhuman reply,&mdash;'But
where do they go to?' 'To the
mountains; some stop on the road,
some die, others get home almost expiring
with misery and famine, only
to follow the same life next year.'</p>

<p>The Malaria is one of those singular
phenomena whose origin has baffled
every effort at discovery, and the
remedy for which has never yet been
ascertained. Attempts have been
made to cultivate the soil of the Maremma,
and colonies were established
within its circuit, but the resistless
scythe of sure and silent death swept
away the presumptuous intruders.&mdash;During
half of the year, a few miserable
beings, armed with lances and
clothed in skins, the living images of
death, wander over these devoted
plains with their flocks; and if accident
should delay their return to the
mountains, fall certain victims to this
fatal disease. Immense numbers of
sheep, cows, horses, and goats find a
subsistence on these wastes and supply
the markets of Rome and the Val
d'Arno. The soil is extremely steril;
the whiteness of the pure argil being
only alloyed by a mixture of sulphur,
which is produced in great profusion.
The cause of the Malaria, as we before
remarked, has escaped all the investigations
of science; it still remains
a mystery no less profound,
than its effects are dreadful. Some
have supposed it to arise from the
low pools of stagnant waters, which
collect on the face of the Maremma;
but the disease prevails on the heights
of Radiocofani and within the lofty
precincts of Volterra.</p>

<p>Some have supposed that the disease
was caused by exposure to the
sudden changes of temperature at the
going down of the sun.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This is supported,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
it is true, by the very weighty
face related by de Bonsteten in his
<cite>Voyage au Latium</cite>, of a man who
resided at Ardea sixteen years without
being indisposed. But we doubt
whether any solution that has ever been
proposed was so perfectly ridiculous
or so completely destitute of foundation.
Do the people then die in the
towns of this disease, where we know
it to be a custom not to go out after
dark, of mere exposure to a changing
atmosphere? A short distance
from the Porta del Popolo at Rome
are two villas, one on each side of a
small lane, but both situated on high
ground. We were informed that during
the summer season, a man would
run very imminent danger of death
in sleeping in one, while he might remain
in the other with perfect impunity.
How is this to be reconciled
with the doctrine that the disease
caused by the Malaria is nothing but
fever and ague, brought on by exposure?
The truth is, this dreadful enemy
every year makes further inroads;
no longer satisfied with pursuing the
wretched thousands of enervated labourers
and shepherds, who at evening
crowd for safety into Rome, it is
advancing into the city in the midst
of darkness, and spreading from the
Porta del Popolo, on the one side,
and from the Palatine on the other,
up the sides of the Quirinal. In 1791,
says M. de Chateauvieux, Rome had
a population of 160,000; at the time
of this visit, it numbered only 100,000,
of whom more than 10,000 were gardeners,
shepherds, and vine-dressers.
Four years afterwards we heard it
computed at from 80 to 90,000. Undoubtedly
political events have had
no small effect in diminishing the
number of inhabitants; but still we believe
the Malaria must have had a no
less powerful influence. Annually it
roams over the finest villas without
the walls, and ravages large districts
of the town within; and neither the
magnificence of the villa Borghese,
nor the luxuriant beauty and towering
pines of Doria Pamfili, can resist
the assaults of this silent and deadly
foe. Time seems to hold its mantle
over the queen of cities, and to prepare
by a fate as extraordinary as its
former history, to blot it out from the
admiration of mortals. Encompassed
already by the awful stillness of a desolate
waste, once filled up with sixty
towns, which the antiquarian in vain
attempts to trace, perhaps her own
site may be hereafter unknown; and
some future traveller may boast with
enthusiasm of having once again penetrated
its deserted streets, of having
visited the spot enobled by the heroic
virtue of Junius Brutus, or the
eloquence and wisdom of Cato the
censor. But we must leave a subject,
on which we could dwell still
longer with delight, and conclude our
notice of a book, of which we would
hope our readers have received a favourable
impression. The subject of
the work is not only important in itself,
but most interesting to us. Italy
is essentially an agricultural country;
she is neither a manufacturing nor a
commercial state. It is by her agriculture,
that she supports more than
17,000,000 of inhabitants, or about
1237 to a square league; a population
far superiour to that of France
or England. It is her agriculture
which laid the foundations of those
splendid cities which crowd her
plains; it is her agriculture, which,
should it ever be protected by an enlightened
government, will again
yield nourishment to the principles
of liberty, and raise her to a level
with the most respectable nations of
Europe. M. de Chateauvieux has
devoted himself to the illustration of
this noble subject, and we are confident
that his work will not only afford
many valuable hints to the practical
farmer, but some lessons to
our statesmen, in any future attempts
which may be made to elevate manufactures
at the expense of the most
dear and invaluable interests in our
country.</p>

<h2>PARMESAN CHEESE DAIRY.</h2>

<p class="center">From a Journey in Carniola, &amp;c. by W. A. Cadell, &amp;c.</p>


<p>"On the 14th April (1818,) I went
to see a large cheese dairy, 3 miles
from Milan, one of the dairies at
which that kind of cheese, called in
commerce <em>Parmesan</em>, is made. It is
called in Italy, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Formaggio di grana</i>,
because it is commonly used in a granular
form, being grated, and brought
to table to be eaten with soup. Much
of this cheese is also made near Lodi
and Pavia.</p>

<p>The word <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Formaggio</i> is from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formaticum</i>,
which signifies, in the Latin
of the middle ages, cheese prepared
in a form.</p>

<p>The cheese is made in the morning
before sunrise.</p>

<p>The morning's milk, and that of
the preceding evening, are put into
a large brass vessel, five feet in
height, narrow at bottom, and widening
out like a trumpet to three feet
diameter at top. This vessel is
placed over a fire, which is sunk in
the ground, and the vessel can be removed
from the fire by a crane.</p>

<p>When the milk is heated, runnet,
in form of paste, is put in, and a little
saffron, to give the cheese the yellow
colour.</p>

<p>When the coagulation has taken
place, the copper is taken off the fire,
the curd is taken out in a cloth, and
put within a broad wooded hoop, the
sides of which are as high as the
cheese is intended to be. This hoop
can be straitened by means of a rope.
A board is placed on the top of the
cheese, and a small weight on the
board. The cheese is not cut into a
press.</p>

<p>After this, the cheese is taken to
the salting room, and two cheeses are
placed together, one above the other,
with broad hoops tightened round
them. Much salt is laid on the top
of the uppermost cheese; the salt
dissolves, and the brine filters through
the cheeses.</p>

<p>The cheeses are shifted from one
place to another all along the benches
of the salting room, and are beaten
with a flat piece of wood, cut with
straight-lined furrows intersecting
each other.</p>

<p>The cheese is next taken to the
magazine, where each cheese is placed
on a shelf.</p>

<p>The sides of the cheese are painted
with a mixture of litmus, otherwise
called <em>tournesol</em>, and oil, to give them
the purple colour. The tournesol is
a plant collected in the south of
France.</p>

<p>The cheeses are set on the shelf in
the same order in which they were
made; and the cheeses of each month
are placed together.</p>

<p>Those of the month of October
and of May are the best, and bear the
highest price. The best cheeses can
be kept longest, and are improved by
keeping for some years.</p>

<p>There was an October cheese
which had been kept five years, and
was to be sent to the emperor.</p>

<p>After the great cheese is made,
the liquid in the copper is again
heated over the fire, and curd is
collected from it to make small
cheeses, called <em>Mascarla</em>.</p>

<p>The number of cows kept for making
cheese in this dairy is eighty.&mdash;They
are always in the house in winter,
and at the present season of the
year. They are fed upon grass all
the year, except perhaps in December.
The house in which they are
kept is not above nine feet high to
the ceiling. They are not kept very
clean. In summer, they go out to
the field to feed during the day.</p>

<p>The cows are of a dark colour,
and are brought from Switzerland,
which is found more profitable than
rearing them in this country. The
bull is also Swiss, and fourteen months
old.</p>

<p>It is estimated that 2000 head of
cattle pass the Mount St. Gothard
every year coming from Switzerland
into Italy. Considerable fairs for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
sale of Swiss cattle are held at Lugano.</p>

<p>The evening's milk is put in flat
copper vessels, three feet in diameter,
in order to collect the cream.</p>

<p>There is an ice-house in the dairy,
for the purpose of supplying ice for
cooling the cream which is put into
the churn. This, they find, facilitates
the making of butter at certain periods
of the year.</p>

<p>In the farm-yard is an inscription,
commemorating the visit paid to this
dairy by the Austrian emperor and
the archdukes, two years ago."</p>

<h2>WILD RICE.</h2>

<p class="center">From the New York Statesman.</p>


<p>Extract of a letter, dated Canandaigua,
July, 1820.</p>

<p>I saw for the first time in the Seneca
river at Montezuma, the aquatic
plant called wild rice, or folle arvine.
It grows all over the west and north;
and wherever it flourishes, myriads of
waterfowl are attracted to it, and derive
their chief support and exquisite
flavour from its alimentary qualities.
In the lakes and rivers adjoining
Montezuma, thousands of wild geese
and ducks of all kinds congregate at
the proper season for food, except the
canvas back duck, or anas valsineria
of Wilson, which derives its name
from a water plant called valsineria,
on the roots of which it feeds, and
which Wilson states to be a fresh
water vegetable, that grows in some
parts of the Hudson and Delaware,
and in most of the rivers that fall into
the Chesapeake.</p>

<p>Some difficulty has occurred not
only about the botanical name, but
also about the botanical character of
the wild rice, or wild oats. The confusion
of nomenclature has arisen from
Linnæus himself. In his Species
Plantarum, he has denominated it
zezania aquatica, and in his mantisa,
zezania palustris&mdash;and it has been
called by other botanists, zezania
claurlosa. I shall prefer the first
name as most characteristic. It has
been well described by Mr. Lambert,
as zezania panicula inferne racemosa
superne spicata. Pursh represents it
as a perennial plant. Nuttall and
Michaux are silent on this point, and
Eaton says it is an annual, in which
opinion I concur.</p>

<p>Mr. Lambert, in a communication
in the 7th volume of the Transactions
of the Linnæan Society of London,
has given a figure of this plant as
growing at Spring Grove, the seat
of sir Joseph Banks, in England. It
appears that sir Joseph received some
of the seed gathered in a lake, in Canada,
and put it in jars of water. It
was sown in a pond at Spring Grove,
where he has a great quantity of the
plant, growing annually, ripening its
seeds extremely well in autumn, and
sowing itself round the edges.</p>

<p>By what I can learn, this same plant
grows in Lake George, and Lake
Champlain, and in all the western
lakes. It produces seed in some
places in September, and in others in
October. It grows in shallow water,
and, sometimes to the height of eight
feet. Some of the western Indians
derive their principal support from it.
The grain it bears is superior to the
common rice, and if cut before ripe,
it makes excellent fodder, embracing
the advantages of hay and oats. Mr.
Lambert's figure of the plant in the
Linnæan Transactions is accurate,
and exactly resembles the one growing
in the Seneca River. Its productiveness
may be inferred from the
food it furnishes to thousands of human
beings, and to myriads of aquatic
animals. From the success of the
experiments of Sir Joseph Banks, it
is highly probable that it will grow in
any part of this country and Great
Britain; and if so, may it not be considered
as a good substitute for the
oryza sativa, or common rice. It is
well known that the latter furnishes
more subsistence to the human race
than any other plant. Pursh mentions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
a grass which he calls the oryzopsis
asperifolia, which he observed on the
broad mountains of this country, and
which he says contains large seeds,
that produce the finest flour. Perhaps
this species of oryzopsis, although
generally different, bears the
same relation to z aquatica in its importance
and place of growth, as the
mountain rice of India does to the
common rice of that region. At all
events, the more I see of this country,
the more I am convinced of its vast
ability to support the human species
and of the propriety of calling its latent
powers into operation.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>ON SEEDS.</h2>


<p>Among plants, as among animals,
there are different breeds to be found,
some mean, some middling, and some
quite superior. The intelligent grazier,
or raiser of cattle of every sort,
selects the finest animals he can find
for breeders of his future stock; and
in this way he experiences a wonderful
improvement in its value, whether
the stock be of horses, neat cattle,
sheep, or swine. The same precaution
should be observed by the agriculturist
in the selection of the seeds
of different plants which he cultivates&mdash;he
should constantly select his seeds
from the finest breeds of plants of
every kind. In some cases such selections
are attended with more trouble
than with others, but in all cases
it is a matter of the utmost importance
in the improvement of crops.
Some general rules for such selections
shall now be pointed out.</p>

<p>For <i>Indian corn</i>.&mdash;Search for such
stalks as bear two ears, at least, and
take the largest ear of each stalk for
seed, rejecting the grains on both
ends. Pursuing this practice will,
in a few years, increase the corn crop
at least one third.</p>

<p><i>Wheat, Rye, Barley, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Search
among the sheaves for the largest and
best filled heads.&mdash;Sow the grains
taken from these by themselves, and
when the product is sufficient for
seed, sow of this selected stock only.
Repeat the selection about every six
years.</p>

<p><i>Flax, Hemp, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;At the time of
pulling the crop, select the longest
stalks to be found, sow the seed of
these separately, and the product will
probably afford seed sufficient for the
next year's sowing. Repeat this, as
before mentioned.</p>

<p><i>Carrots, Beets, Turnips, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Make
yearly selections of the largest
and most perfect roots, for bearing a
supply of seed for the ensuing year.</p>

<p><i>Pumpkins, Squashes, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Select
such plants as bear the greatest <em>number</em>
or the greatest <em>quantity</em> of pumpkins,
or squashes, &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash;take the
<em>largest</em> of the produce of each plant,
and after opening them, the quality
for <em>sweetness</em> of each can be ascertained.
Select your seeds for the
next year's crop, from the sweetest
of the collection.</p>

<p><i>Cabbages.</i>&mdash;Preserve the stalks for
seed, which bore the largest and finest
heads, or leaves, according to the sort
of cabbage.</p>

<p><i>Apples, Pears, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;No selections
from the seeds of these, will insure
the same sorts of fruit as those from
whence the seeds were taken. The
finest of these fruits are only to be
obtained by ingrafting. It is however
said, that by taking the seeds only
from the south sides of such apples
or pears, as grow on the finest of
these fruit trees, varieties of young
trees will be afforded from such seeds
nearly equal to those from whence
the seeds were taken.</p>

<p><i>Peaches, Plums, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Make your
selections from such trees as bear the
finest fruit, and from that growing on
the south side of the trees. If you
wish to make the young stock of fruit
earlier than that of the parent tree,
make your selections of such peaches
or plums as ripen first, and these will
always be found on the south side of
the tree.</p>

<p>For preserving the germinative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
power of seeds, let them be mixed
with a due proportion of sugar.</p>

<p>There is, in most cases, perhaps in
all, a very essential advantage to be
derived from a change of seeds, or
bringing them from one part of the
world to be sown in another. Sufficient
attention has not, however, been
paid to this matter to enable us to
ascertain what changes prove most
beneficial; but in making them, regard
must doubtless be had that the
seeds be taken from climates not too
widely dissimilar. In bringing southern
seeds to be sown in northerly
climates, the danger is, that they will
want sufficient time for ripening, and
in pursuing the reverse of this, the
crop may ripen so early as to be, on
that account, lessened in its products.</p>

<p>In raising seeds of plants of which
there are different species, it is essential
that the seed plants be placed so
far apart as to preclude any danger
of the pollen of the one being carried
by the winds to the other; for if an
intermixture of breeds take place, a
degeneracy of the plants must ensue,
by mixing the valuable qualities of
each. In the <i>Brascia</i> tribe, for instance,
there is one species denominated
cabbages, of many varieties,
and are valuable for their heads or
leaves; another species is the common
turnip, of several varieties, and
valuable for its bulbous root; and
another is the Swedish turnip or Ruta
Baga, whose principle excellence is
its bulbous stalk. The effect, therefore,
of an admixture of these plants,
must be a diminution of the bulbs of
the two latter, and an increase of foliage,
while the cabbages would lessen
in the heads and leaves, with a proportionate
augmentation of stalk and
roots.</p>

<h2>HOLKHAM SHEEP-SHEARING, (ENG.)</h2>


<p>This festival, established by T. W.
Coke, Esq. forty-three years ago,
commenced on 10th July last.&mdash;&mdash;Among
the company present this
year were, his Royal Highness the
Duke of Sussex, Princes Potemkin
and Trabetzkoy, (Russia,) the Marquis
of Downshire, Earl of Albemarle;
Lords Waterpark, Erskine, Anson,
Ebrington, Lynedock, Delaware;&mdash;Hon.
Mr. Keppel, Hon. Geo. Walpole,
Hon. Gen. Fitzroy, Hon. Mr.
Thellison, Sir John Sinclair, Bart.
Sir Wm. Hoste, Bart. T. W. Coke,
jr. Esq. M. P.; G. W. Hall, Esq.
Thos. Gay, Esq. (Herts,) Robert Patterson,
Esq. (Baltimore,) C. Deering,
Esq. (Middlesex,) Mons. Petit, Esq.
(Paris,) Thos. B. Beevor, Esq. J. Ellman,
Esq. (Sussex,) and many eminent
agriculturists from Norfolk, Suffolk,
and various parts of the kingdom.
This festival, instituted for the improvement
of agriculture, assumes, at
every anniversary, a greater degree
of interest and importance.</p>

<p>Among the sheep exhibited there
was an Arabian, and one from New
Zealand; likewise a half-bred Zealand
lamb, from a Southdown ewe.
The Arabian sheep is a large animal,
covered with a close coat of hair, like
our pointer dogs. The colour of the
one exhibited was white, with a black
head and neck. The tail is very singularly
formed&mdash;a large piece of loose
flesh projects from the rump, above
which grows a tail, about four inches
in length, exactly resembling that of
a young pig; the sheep has also a
large pouch under the jaw.</p>

<p>A simple but most effectual method
of preventing rats and mice from
injuring corn stalks, was recommended
by Mr. Gibbs. of Quarles, a tenant
to Mr. Coke. The cost is not more
than 6s. or 7s. per stack; and it has
been found by several gentlemen who
have made the trial, to be a complete
bar to the depredations of those destructive
vermin. The stack is cut
round, and merely plastered with common
lime and hair, about three feet
high; and when properly done, it will
be found that no vermin can possibly
make their way into the stacks.</p>

<p>Mr. Coke pronounced the <em>grubber</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
to be one of the most useful implements
upon his farm, and pointed out
its superiority over the scarifier, which
cuts the roots of the weeds in pieces,
and thereby multiplies them; instead
of which the grubber forces them up
in an entire state, and even their finest
fibres are destroyed. Alluding to his
own farms as a proof of what a better
mode of husbandry would effect, Mr.
Coke observed, with respect to what
was frequently said of the injury accruing
from the introduction of machinery,
that he employed more hands
with the machinery than he could
any other way. Of the mode of <em>driling</em>,
he said, it should be from north
to south, instead of from east to west.
This might appear of trivial moment,
but he could assert that it was worthy
of attention.</p>

<p>About 500 persons each day sat
down to dinner in the noble mansion;
when a scene of hilarity and cheerfulness,
intermixed with valuable information
from the gentlemen whose
healths were drank, was exhibited.
Mr. Coke, at the close of the meeting
on Wednesday evening, delivered
the prizes to the successful candidates
in the various classes.</p>

<h2>AGRICULTURAL MEMORANDA.</h2>


<p><i>Flax for Cambrics.</i>&mdash;The culture
of this species of flax is an object of
great importance to every farmer.&mdash;The
produce of a single acre has
been known to bring in Flanders upwards
of $380. It requires a deep
and rich soil, and must be sticked or
supported nearly as peas, as it grows
twice as high as the ordinary flax;
but the labour attending this is amply
compensated by the produce.</p>

<p><i>Hops.</i>&mdash;The essential oil of hops,
obtained by distillation, and afterwards
mixed with a small quantity of sugar,
is found to be the best way of using
that plant in brewing, and the most
effectual method of preserving it for
years.</p>

<p><i>Squashes.</i>&mdash;It has been asserted, as
the result of an accidental experiment,
that squashes sown in the Fall
will survive the frosts of winter and
spring, and will ripen much earlier
than any which can be raised by sowing
in the spring. Those sown in the
spring, and those sown in the fall,
were, in the case alluded to, exposed
to a severe frost; the former were
killed, while the latter survived. It
may be worth a more satisfactory experiment.
The earliest salads, we
know, are grown in this way. The
same has been said of a species of
beans, and even potatoes.</p>

<p><i>Salt as a Manure.</i>&mdash;In the history
of the cocoa nut tree, by M. le Goux,
the author tells us that the inhabitants
of those parts of Hindostan and China,
which border on the sea coast, sprinkle
their rice fields with sea water,
and use no other manure; and that
in the interior of these countries, they
sprinkle the lands with salt before they
are tilled, a practice which has been
followed for ages with the greatest
advantage. Park says, he was informed
by a gentleman in England,
who had spent many years in making
experiments on the employment of
salt in Agriculture, "that one bushel
to an acre makes land always more
productive; but that a larger quantity
would, for two or three years afterwards,
render it actually sterile."</p>

<h2>AMERICAN GINSENG.</h2>

<p class="center">Extract from the New Monthly Magazine, on the
"American Trade with China."</p>


<p>Above all, a remarkable production
deserves to be mentioned here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
which grows in America itself, and
is almost peculiar to the United
States; a production which is almost
wholly unknown in Europe, but has
been in use in China from time immemorial,
and is held there in extraordinary
esteem. This is the root
Panax quinquefolia, or Ginseng. The
Chinese writers call this plant a precious
gift of nature, sweeter than honey
and the honey comb, more valuable
than fine gold, and jewels, and
pearls, a glorious gift of Heaven, bestowed
by the gods upon mortals for
their happiness, and their enjoyment
on earth. Placed on a par with the
philosopher's stone, it is called the
food of immortality, and it passes
among the priests and physicians for
a universal remedy, wholesome for all
weakness of the frail body, applicable
to all diseases; nay, it is even said to
prolong life, invigorating the nerves,
strengthening the understanding,
cheering the soul, soothing the mind,
taming the wild passions, and bestowing
inexhaustible delights upon our
mortal existence.</p>

<p>The reigning dynasty of the Mantchews,
in China, were proud that Nature
produced this wonderful root,
with such magical powers, in their
original country; for it was found in
Chinese Mogul Tartary; but sparingly
scattered in certain places and
districts. Here it was considered as
one of the regalia of the crown, only
the emperor had the right to have it
gathered, and guards were posted at
the places where it grew, that no one
might presume to take openly, or by
stealth, what was for the emperor
alone. How fortunate was it for the
Americans, that they accidentally discovered,
not very long ago, that this
root, so highly esteemed in China,
and paid for there with its weight in
gold, which it had been always supposed
was only to be found in Tartary,
as the Chinese had always boasted,
was indigenous in the United States,
and might be there collected in far
greater abundance than in China, hitherto
the only country where it was
known to grow.</p>

<p>It grows in the United States, in
the whole of the immense tract from
the Canadian Lakes to Georgia; is
found even in the northern states of
New York and Pennsylvania, and
flourishes in Virginia and the two
Carolinas. Nature has spread it here,
particularly in the tract between the
Alleghany mountains and the sea, and
it thrives especially where the mountains
take a southwesterly direction.
It loves a fertile soil, and cool shady
spots, on the declivity of the mountains.</p>

<p>While Europe produces nothing
which it can offer to the Chinese in
exchange for their productions, America
possesses in this remarkable plant
an article peculiarly its own, which
is, above all others, proper for the
trade with China.</p>

<p>Many of your readers may, perhaps,
be curious to be better acquainted
with a plant so esteemed by the
great Chinese Mandarins, and in the
Harems.</p>

<p>The stalk of this plant, which attains
the height of about a foot from
the ground, is of a dark red. It is
adorned with elliptical leaves, three
of which always grow together, and
each of which is again divided into
five little leaves. On account of the
symbolical meaning attached to the
numbers three and five, which these
leaves present to the eye, the plant
obtained, in ancient times, in China,
the character of particular sacredness.
The growth of this singular
plant is extremely slow, but then it
attains an age unusual in plants of this
kind; when it has stood fifteen years
or more, the root it not yet an inch in
diameter. Every year the stalk makes
at the upper part of the root, at each
new shoot, marks, which show by their
number the age of the plant. The
root itself is of an elliptical form, and
commonly consists only of one piece.
The plant bears but a few seeds; two
or three grains are all that can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
gathered from one stem; these are of
a bright red colour, in shape and size
like those that may be collected from
the honeysuckle. They ripen in
America, in the latter half of the
month of September, and their taste
is more aromatic than that of the root
itself, but less bitter.</p>

<p>In China the greatest care is taken
in gathering this valuable root. It is
not done till it has attained the highest
perfection and maturity: this is
during the autumn and winter. In
America they long committed, from
ignorance and inattention, the great
fault of collecting the root from the
spring to the first frost. As it is always
soft and watery at this season, it
naturally shrunk together in drying,
became very hard, and lost not only
in weight but in goodness. This mistake
is still committed in some parts
of the United States, where the inhabitants
make the collecting of the
root only an occasional object; and
when they are hunting or travelling,
dig up the plant at all seasons when
they happen to meet with it. But
by this they deprive the ground of a
valuable production, which would be
far more valuable if it were tended
and cultivated with due care. Though
the Ginseng roots thus collected by
ignorant persons do not fetch in China
the high prices which are given for
such as have attained their proper
maturity, yet the demand for them
is not the less brisk. The American
merchants in the interior purchase
large quantities by the pound, or the
hundred weight, of the country people,
who employ themselves in collecting
and digging this root, and gain
by exporting it to China, about one
hundred per cent.</p>

<p>But the profit is incomparably
greater when Ginseng roots, perfectly
ripe, and carefully gathered at the
proper time, are brought to Macao
or China. The Americans begin to
be more sensible of this advantage,
in proportion as the intercourse with
China becomes more active. They
have made themselves better acquainted
with the nature of the plant,
and the taste of the Chinese; employ
greater care in gathering, and acquire
more skill in digging it. One man
can gather about eight or nine pounds
daily. Hence the quantity of this
article exported from the United
States increases at the same time that
its quality improves; and the trade
with Ginseng roots in the Chinese
markets continues to become more
and more profitable to America. The
exportation already amounts to at
least 500 cwt. annually.</p>

<p>In China they understand the art
of preparing the Ginseng, in such a
manner, that it appears semi-transparent:
in this case a much higher
value is set upon it. In America
they have also learnt this art, and the
process employed is very simple.&mdash;The
merchants in the American
commercial towns, purchase the roots
so prepared, and rendered partly
transparent, at six or seven piasters
apiece; and sell them in China, according
to the quality, at from fifty
to a hundred piasters apiece. Even
in Louisiana and Kentucky, they carry
on this extremely profitable export
trade to China.</p>

<h2>EDUCATION.</h2>


<p>The Easton, (Md.) Gazette, in
treating of the importance of Education,
and the advantages, under a
republican government, of close application
to study, concludes with the
following characteristic allusions:</p>

<p>Who was Mr. Wirt, the present
Attorney General of the U. States?
A poor boy of our state; of the village
of Bladensburgh.&mdash;What has
given him one of the first stations in
the country, with a handsome income?
Good education, laborious
study and application, and consequent
knowledge.</p>

<p>Who was William Pinkney? A
poor boy of Annapolis. What has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
learning made him? The first lawyer;
the most celebrated advocate of our
country.</p>

<p>Who was James Monroe? The
son of a bricklayer in the town of
Cambridge, in Dorset. Who is James
Monroe? The President of these
United States.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Education is the solid granite pedestal
of the column of his fame, supporting
a shaft of the most towering
attitude, whose Corinthian capital is
high above the clouds. How emphatically,
in this instance, has wisdom,
founded on good education, and matured
by intense study and application,
proved herself to be power, with
station, and honours, and wealth, following
in her train. Why then should
not a son of one of our bricklayers,
or hatters, or tailors, or cabinet makers,
become a future President of the
United States?&mdash;The same path is
open to them: true, it winds up the
sides of a steep and rugged mountain;
and the elevated pinnacle is not to be
gained without setting out aright, with
the earliest and best discipline of good
schools, and the severest and most
immense mental labour&mdash;but the
prize is well worth the boldest, the
highest exertion.</p>

<p>Will it be said that Nature made
these men of her best materials? no
such thing. Providence was bountiful
to them; but Nature left these
diamonds as rough, as many of the
pebbles now in the streets. Instruction
turned them; and education gave
the high polish and the point, which
illumes and dazzles America, and
throws their radiance far into other
countries. And have we not at this
moment, genius and talents in our
Academy equal to Wirt's, and Pinkney's,
and Monroe's? Yes, without
doubt, and among the sons of our
mechanics too&mdash;and would to Heaven
I could fire their young bosoms with
the noblest ambition, without which
they can never reach what they aim
at.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2>THE TURKMANS.</h2>


<p>The following extract is taken from
Mr. Browne's MS. remains: on his
journey across Asia Minor he thus
describes a very remarkable people:</p>

<p>"In my visits to the Turkman
tents, I remarked a strong contrast
between their habits and those of the
Bedouin Arabs. With the latter,
the rights of hospitality are inviolable;
and while the host possesses a cake
of bread, he feels it a duty to furnish
half of it to his guest; the Turkman
offers nothing spontaneously, and if
he furnish a little milk or butter, it
is at an exorbitant price. With him
it is a matter of calculation, whether
the compendious profit of a single act
of plunder, or the more ignoble system
of receiving presents from the
caravans for their secure passage, be
most advantageous. The Arab values
himself on the <i>hasb we nasb</i>, that is,
his ancient pedigree; the Turkman,
on his personal prowess. With the
former, civility requires that salutations
be protracted to satiety; the
latter scarcely replies to a <i>Salam
aleikum</i>.</p>

<p>"The muleteers, who had preferred
this devious path to the high
road, to avoid the dellis, were now
alarmed at the frequent visits of the
Turkmans. They described me to
them as an officer of Chappan Oglou's
retinue, employed to communicate
with the English fleet on the coast;
an explanation which appeared to satisfy
them; and fortunately I was able
to support that character. It is to be
observed that Chappan Oglou has a
large military force at his disposal,
and administers justice with a rod of
iron. His vengeance pursues, on
eagle-wing, the slightest transgression
against his authority. Our precautions
at night were redoubled;
and I divided the time into two
watches, which I ordered my servant
to share with me; but the disposition
to sleep having speedily got the better
of his vigilance, a pipe, although
carefully placed under the carpet on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
which I myself slept, was stolen unperceived
before morning.</p>

<p>"The dress of the Turkmans consists
of a large striped and fringed
turban, fastened in a manner peculiar
to themselves; or sometimes of a
simple high-crowned cap of white
felt. A vest, usually white, is thrown
over the shirt; the Agas superadd
one of cloth; and in general, and in
proportion to their rank and wealth,
they approximate to the dress of the
capital. But the common people
wear a short jacket of various colours.
A cincture is indispensably required,
in which are fixed an enormous yatagan,
and a pistol. Many of them wear
half boots, red or yellow, laced to the
leg: the dress of the women is a coloured
vest, and a piece of white cotton
cloth on the head, covering part
of the face. They are masculine and
active, performing all the harder
kinds of labour required by the family.
Their features are good, but not pleasing.
The men are generally muscular,
and well-proportioned; tall,
straight, and active. Their teeth are
white and regular; their eyes are
often extremely piercing; and there
is an air of uncommon boldness in
their countenances and mode of address.
Their complexions are clear,
but sun-burnt. In a word, they have
every thing that denotes exhaustless
health and vigour of body. A general
resemblance is visible between
them and the populace of Constantinople;
but the latter appear effeminate
by the comparison. Every action
and every motion of the Turkmans is
marked by dignity and grace. Their
language is clear and sonorous, but
less soft than that of the capital; expressing,
as may be conceived, no
abstract ideas, for which the Turkish
is indebted to the Arabic alone; but
fitted to paint the stronger passions,
and to express, in the most forcible
and laconic terms, the mandates of
authority. Their riches consist of
cattle, horses, arms, and various habiliments.
How lamentable to think,
that with persons so interesting, and
a character so energetic, they unite
such confirmed habits of idleness, violence,
and treachery! From the rising
of the sun till his disappearance,
the males are employed only in smoking,
conversing, inspecting their cattle,
or visiting their acquaintance.
They watch at night for the purpose
of plunder, which among them is honourable,
in proportion to the ingenuity
of the contrivance, or the audacity
of the execution. Their families
are generally small, and there seems
reason to believe that their numbers
are not increasing."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>PUNCTUALITY.</h2>


<p>An English traveller, who has just
published an account of a Journey in
Holland, makes the following remark&mdash;"The
Dutch are as punctual as
they are industrious and parsimonious.
The diligences and treckschuyts
start at the time appointed, during
the striking of the clock. If you are
told that the hour is seven, you may
be sure to be away before the fourth
of the seven strokes has sounded.&mdash;The
precision at which the hour of
arrival is fixed, is such that you may
depend upon it within a few minutes;
and the same reliance may be placed
on the period of finishing the journey,
whether it be made by water or by
land." This is a most valuable trait of
character in that people, and is well
worthy of universal imitation. There
are a considerable proportion of mankind
who are always behind-hand.&mdash;Let
them make ever so many or so
important engagements, as it respects
punctuality in time, they invariably
fail.&mdash;Many such have fallen within
our observation; and the same want
of exactness in point of time attends
all their concerns. If they go to
church upon the sabbath, they will
not get there until after the services
have commenced&mdash;and this happens
to good, sober, pious Christians, as
well as others; and it happens all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
their lives. Such is the inveteracy of
this habit of negligence, that people,
who would be shocked at the irreverence
of any person who should so
far forget himself as to disturb the
devotions of a religious congregation
by speaking, or in any other thoughtless
manner, seem to have no idea
that their entrance into the church in
the midst of the most solemn exercises,
has any thing in it improper or
censurable.</p>

<p>The same thing occurs in the attendance
of such persons upon public
business, where they are associated
with others. At meetings, appointed
for the transaction of such business,
if any considerable number are necessary
to its accomplishment, there
is often, and indeed usually, as much
time spent in waiting for <i>a quorum</i>,
as is consumed in attending to the
object of the meeting. This is a
great hardship upon those who make
a point of being strictly punctual, for
it costs them a double quantity of
time. And these <em>behind-hand persons</em>,
if they would only suffer themselves
to reflect, could not fail to remember,
that punctuality would cost
themselves no more time than the
want of it. Judging from considerable
experience and observation, we
are very well convinced, that about as
much time is spent in waiting for dilatory
people, as is necessary for transacting
the business immediately in
view when appointments for the purpose
are made.</p>

<p>Espriella, if we do not mistake the
writer, mentions his having taken
passage in a stage coach at York, in
England, which was to start at a certain
hour. A few minutes before the
time, every thing was prepared; the
passengers took their seats; the
coachman mounted his box, took the
reins and his whip, but did not move.
Upon being inquired of why he did
not start, as every thing was ready,
he replied, <em>he was waiting for the
Minster</em>&mdash;which meant the cathedral
church of that name. In a minute
or two the secret was explained&mdash;the
Minster clock began to strike, and
before it had finished, the carriage
was on its way.&mdash;We have no doubt
that this habit in the driver made
every body who intended to make use
of his vehicle strictly punctual. If,
however, instead of starting at the
moment, he had practised waiting
5 minutes, occasionally, there would
have been much delay and vexation,
by the dilatoriousness of these behind-hand
persons of whom we are speaking.
We scarcely ever recollect to
have been on the wharf when a steamboat
was casting off, without finding
some person left, or running with
breathless speed to get aboard, being
a few minutes <em>too late</em>. Such persons,
when they find themselves safe
on the deck, will almost always look
at their watches, and find it <em>a few
minutes later than they imagined</em>, or
their watches a little too slow, or
something else is made chargeable
with the evil&mdash;when the honest truth
is, <em>they are naturally or habitually
behind-hand</em>.</p>

<p>It is not easy to imagine, unless our
attention has been particularly turned
to the subject, how much time is lost,
and how much a man's affairs suffer,
from this dilatory disposition. It will
more or less run through and affect
all his concerns. A dilatory man is
perpetually in a hurry. His business
always drives him&mdash;and business
transacted in a hurry, is rarely well
done. We once knew a respectable
mechanic, whose habit of punctuality
was such, that in carrying on his trade
quite extensively for more than forty
years, he never disappointed a single
customer by not having his work done
at the time appointed&mdash;he never failed
of sitting down to his meals within
five minutes of the time&mdash;he made
his family, as well as his workmen,
conform strictly to his rules of punctuality&mdash;and
it hardly need be added,
that he always supported the fairest
reputation as a man of business&mdash;and
that he acquired an independent property,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
beyond the handsome support
of a large and expensive family.</p>

<h2>NATURAL CURIOSITY.</h2>


<p>Most of our readers, no doubt, have
noticed accounts of living toads, that
have been found enclosed in stones
and trees. This is perhaps one of the
most extraordinary facts that has come
within the observation of naturalists;
so extraordinary, indeed, that few, on
the first mention of it, have given it
credence. So many instances, however,
have occurred, attested by authority
so respectable, that it would
seem there now remains little room
for doubt. Some of the most remarkable
may here be mentioned&mdash;instances
that are well substantiated, and
which have led inquiring men to investigate
as minutely as possible the
philosophy of the matter.&mdash;A living
toad was found in a large stone at
Newark, on Trent, in England&mdash;it
was white, measured three and a half
inches, and appeared incapable of
bearing light; for its motions argued
an incompatible state, and in an
hour it died. But in this time it was
seen by several hundred people.&mdash;Three
living toads were discovered
lying together in a stone quarry near
Cassel. No aperture was discoverable
on the outside of the stone. The
toads could with difficulty be removed
from their bed, and endeavoured to
return whenever they were removed,
but died in the course of half an hour.
More of the same kind might be added;
every one's recollection will no
doubt, supply him with instances
which have occurred in our own
country. Though naturalists have
endeavoured to account for this astonishing
fact, yet we think their speculations
have been in general very
visionary. The best account we have
seen, is that by J. G. J. Ballenstedt,
rector of Papsdorf, in the duchy of
Brunswick. The substance of this
we present to our readers, hoping
that will at least be found amusing, at
a time when political news is scarce,
and uninteresting. More than amusement
need not be expected; for we
regard his speculation as we do most
speculations of mineralogical travellers
and geological societies&mdash;mighty
light, airy and unsubstantial stuff.
But let his rectorship be heard.</p>

<p>Another world besides the one we
now inhabit, has had its existence, inhabited,
as ours is, by animals terrestrial
and marine. A time was when
all that is now land was covered by
the ocean, as the secondary mountains,
with their beds of petrified marine
productions, abundantly prove.
"There, where at present the plough
turns up the soil, and countless cornfields
shine with their golden harvests&mdash;where
immense forests spread their
luxuriant trees, among which numerous
wild animals sport&mdash;where hills
and mountains raise their varied summits&mdash;where
herds of cattle graze&mdash;where
rivulets and rapid streams
wind through valleys, and where cities
and villages are now situated&mdash;there
formerly raged the waves of this
ocean&mdash;there swarmed hosts of marine
animals, of numberless forms
and magnitudes."&mdash;The Almighty
spoke, the waters disappeared, and
these animals were left on dry land;
those belonging to the dry land were
swallowed up, together with their habitations,
in the great deep. Sea
animals that have been petrified, are
found at the present day in the bosom
of the earth; and under the bottom
of the sea are discovered river muscles
and the beds of former great rivers.
Whole forests were buried,
and have been subsequently turned
into coal. The slime and mud of the
bottom of the sea, when left dry, was
hardened into stone, and strata of regular
conformation; which, to produce
the present irregularity met
with among them, (we suppose,) have
undergone divers severe twistifications,
by means of earthquakes, the
great steam engine of geologists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
whose boiler has burst more than
once; we may credit the accounts of
these profound world makers.</p>

<p>During this awful catastrophe, these
living toads were probably enclosed
in their stony prisons. They were
covered and buried with mud, which
afterwards was hardened into stone
by the active exertions of Mr. Unknown
Process, a worthy old gentleman,
of astonishing powers, who occasionally
has the kindness to assist
poor philosophers in their immense
task of creating worlds. In this mud,
poor fellows, they would have gone
the way of all flesh, had it not been
for their peculiar organization; for
they possess the "power of sleeping
and remaining in a state of torpor during
the winter without having occasion
for any nourishment during that
period." When enclosed in mud,
therefore, the same process went on
as in winter, but for a longer time.&mdash;They
had nothing to do but to go to
bed, and get to sleep as soon as possible,
and enjoy a comfortable nap of
several thousand years, till accident
should unhouse them, and turn them
out to enjoy the glorious light of the
sun, and a thousand other things they
had never dreamed of. Being fast
asleep, and so closely and comfortably
wrapped up in a stone blanket several
feet thick, "no exhalation could
take place from them, and, therefore,
there could be no necessity to replace
the lost animal juices by various nourishment."
Wonderful phenomenon!
The toad, this highly and much
despised animal, was of all others the
only one capable of undergoing this
experiment of nature, and, thereby,
of viewing a second time the light of
the world. All others the most noble
and most beautiful of creatures, even
man himself, had it not in his power
to live to see such a blessing. Man,
with his fellow creatures, could only
pass into a new world in a petrified
state; insects of a former world could
only be preserved from complete ruin
in amber, and the mammoth be preserved
partially in ice; but the toad
was capable on account of its tenacious
powers of life, and its peculiar
nature, to pass from the old world into
the new one, in a living state, and
by these means to be snatched from
destruction. It has twice trodden the
theatre of the world!!&mdash;Wonderful
phenomenon! we respond. Wonderful,
indeed, when we take into consideration
the many other created
beings that sleep during winter, which
had the same risk to run of being enclosed
in this mud, and therefore,
"from their peculiar nature," had
the same chance of enjoying a comfortable
nap of several thousand years.</p>

<h2>THE ISLAND OF MADEIRA.</h2>

<p class="center">From a late account of that Island published in
London.</p>


<p>The climate of the island is excellent,
being between the extremes of
heat and cold; indeed the climate and
soil are such, that the fruits of the
earth are yielded with very little trouble
in their cultivation, which, from
the negligence of the inhabitants, is
highly essential.</p>

<p>Nearly every kind of European vegetable
production is to be met with
here, to which may be added the
sweet potato and yam. The same
may be said of fruits, and with care
might be produced most of the tropical
ones. The oranges, lemons, and
figs, are remarkably fine: peaches,
nectarines, apricots &amp;c. are very abundant.</p>

<p>The hills are covered with very
large chesnut and walnut trees; the
former producing the finest fruit of
its kind in the world, and forming one
source of sustenance to the hardy
peasantry.</p>

<p>The island is formed of one immense
hill or mountain, running from
east to west, affording views beautifully
romantic, abounding with fine
springs of the purest water in the
universe; while verdure and fertility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
cover the most unpromising situations.
Pico Ruivo is five thousand
one hundred feet high.</p>

<p>The city of Funchal is very delightfully
situated at the foot of this
lofty range of mountains, on the south
side of the island; which forms a kind
of amphitheatre, and has a beautiful
appearance from the shipping as you
approach it, the environs abounding
with vineyards, generally in the most
luxuriant state; and in the midst of
the green foliage of the vine, orange,
lemon, pomegranate, bannanas, myrtle,
cypress, cedar, &amp;c. are numerous
villas belonging to the gentry, or to
the British merchants, which, being
quite white, add greatly to the beauty
of the scene.</p>

<p>Funchal is the emporium of the island;
it contains about twenty thousand
inhabitants, (the population of
the whole island is one hundred thousand
souls,) and is the residence of a
governor, bishop, corrigidor, juiz da
fora and other public functionaries.
It is a very irregular built town; the
streets are generally narrow and
crooked, having no foot paths, and
are badly paved; but it is quite the
reverse of Lisbon, being extremely
clean. The old houses are ill built;
but they have lately much improved
in architecture, for the modern buildings
are generally handsome, and are
invariably built with stone, plastered
over and whitewashed: most of the
houses of the gentry are stuccoed
inside, many of them are very elegant,
and they are for the most part
handsomely furnished in the English
style.</p>

<p>The residence of the governor is
called the palace of Fort St. Lawrence;
it is a large ancient building:
a few years since, it was greatly improved
by the addition of a new suit
of apartments, built under the direction
of an English gentlemen, which
are elegant and commodious.</p>

<p>Funchal has several handsome
churches, the altar pieces of which
are highly ornamented with paintings,
silver lamps, and railings, together
with richly carved and gilt figures,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>There are, on the island, about
twelve hundred secular priests, governed
by a dean and chapter, with a
bishop at their head.</p>

<p>Funchal towards the sea side, is
protected by a parapet wall, properly
called the musketry parapet: the fortifications
consist of a castle erected
upon a steep rock, on the west side
of the harbour, and is within a few
yards of the shore; it is very ancient,
and mounts nine guns of different calibre.
This fort returns the salute of
the different vessels of war, anchoring
in the roads; and the castle serves
for a state prison.</p>

<p>There is one small vegetable and
fruit market, but the cattle, beef, and
fish markets, are miserable.</p>

<p>The prisons are ill constructed,
badly governed, and insecure. They
are altogether a disgrace to the island.</p>

<p>All the towns and villages, of which
there are several, are invariably situated
on the sea coast.</p>

<p>The country is too uneven for
wheel carriages, except just in the
town and its vicinity; the mode of
travelling, therefore, is on horseback,
or on mules, and in palanquins or
hammocks.</p>

<p>The native inhabitants of Madeira
are commonly of a middling stature,
well limbed, and of a darker complexion
than the inhabitants of the
colder climates of Europe, possessing
a warmth of feeling with more
volatile humour than is usual in the
phlegmatic constitutions of people of
more northern countries, they are
courteous in their dispositions, and are
very polite in their manners among
themselves, as well as towards strangers.
The females display great
taste in adorning their hair, the blackness
of which corresponds with their
dark expressive eyes, and gives them
a very interesting appearance; they
are almost universally distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
for the whiteness of their teeth, the
smallness of their feet, and their finely
turned ancles.</p>

<p>The convulsive state of Europe,
for so many years, occasioned such an
increased demand for the wines of
Madeira, that they have, in consequence,
advanced to nearly treble the
price at which they were sold at the
commencement of the French revolution.
The cause is removed, but
the effect is still continued, by the
impolicy of the British merchants,
who out-bid each other in their purchases
from the land proprietors and
wine-jobbers: this rise in the price of
wine has produced an increase of income
to the landholders, and thus (to
use the language of one of their own
writers) many now live in splendour,
whose parents were content with the
simple manners of their neighbours
on the opposite coast of Barbary.&mdash;Both
sexes dress now in the highest
style of English fashion: while most
of the principle families have their
card and music parties, routes, balls,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>There is no imprisonment for debt,
and condign punishment is never
inflicted in Madeira; for certain
crimes the criminal is sometimes banished
to the Cape de Verds, and when
the crime is death, according to the
Portuguese law, the felon is sent prisoner
to Lisbon, there to await his
fate.</p>

<p>Many of the natives are possessed
of a turn for poetry, and almost the
whole of them are rhymesters.</p>

<p>The islanders have a great taste
for music, and are very graceful dancers.</p>

<p>The highest gratifications of the
natives are the church festivals, and
religious processions; their avidity
for these spectacles is so great, that
they come from all parts of the Island
to see them: although it is constantly
a repetition of the same thing;
the streets are crowded with the delighted
multitude, and the windows
of the houses filled with the senhoras,
who assemble there full dressed
to see and be seen.</p>

<p>It is the custom to bury their dead
within twenty-four hours after their
demise; they carry the body in an
open bier to the place of the interment,
with the face and arms exposed
to full view, attended by a concourse
of priests and friars, chaunting a funeral
dirge (that is when the deceased
leaves money to pay for it, otherwise,
no penny no pater-noster;) then follow
the friends of the departed, and a motley
tribe of beggars bearing lighted
torches, although it should be at mid-day.
When the body is consigned to
the grave, a quantity of lime and vinegar
is thrown in to consume it, in order
to make room for others, as they
always bury within the church. Relatives
do not accompany the funerals,
being supposed to be too much
affected by their loss. Widows of
rank do not cross the threshold for
twelve months after the death of their
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Caro Sposos</i>.</p>

<p>The dress of the peasantry is very
simple, consisting of a shirt and drawers
of linen of their own manufacture,
the knee-bands of the latter and
collar of the former are worn both
open, a pair of loose light goat-skin
boots, which, with a small blue cloth
cap, of a conical shape turned up
with red, completes their dress; although
they have a blue cloth jacket,
but it is generally thrown over one
shoulder, being seldom worn. They
are very civil when they meet a stranger;
they take off their cap, and
"hope the Lord will prosper him;"
and when they encounter one another,
they stand cap in hand, though under
a perpendicular sun, till they have
satisfied each other as to the welfare
of their wives, children, relatives, acquaintances,
cattle, domestic animals,
and so on: there is then a good deal
of ceremony in settling the important
question who shall first put his cap
on again. They are very muscular,
and are capable of undergoing incredible
fatigue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>A more desirable spot for the
asthmatic or consumptive, uniting
such numerous advantages cannot be
found; the town of Funchal being
situated in a valley open only to the
south, while it is completely defended
by the mountains rising behind,
from those northern blasts, which in
other situations too often prove fatal
in cases of decline; and the temperature
of the atmosphere is very little
subject to change, the thermometer
being seldom higher than from 75
to 78 in summer, and rarely below 65
in winter; indeed, the climate is so
favourable for invalids, that were it
resorted to before the disease becomes
too long confirmed, it would seldom
fail in restoring their health; but it is
to be regretted that this resource is
often deterred till it is too late for any
hopes of recovery, and when the patient
has scarcely strength to undergo
the fatigues of the voyage.</p>

<p>When the Island was first colonized,
prince Henry had the sugar
transplanted hither from Sicily; and,
at one time, there were forty sugar
mills on the Island, that article then
forming the staple commodity; now
there is only one mill remaining, at
which little sugar is made, but that
little is excellent, and has a scent like
the violet.</p>

<p>Instead of the cane the vine is now
cultivated, the produce of which is
well known and esteemed all over the
world: the vines run on trellises of
cane work, about three feet from the
ground, and the grape is usually fit
for making into wine at the beginning
of September, when they are obliged
to tie up all the dogs, to prevent their
getting at the grapes, of which they
are very fond. Great quantities are
destroyed by rats, lizards, and wasps.</p>

<p>The wine-press is a wooden trough,
about six feet square, and two feet
deep, over which is a large clumsy
lever. When the trough is nearly
filled, about half a dozen peasants
bare-legged, get in, and, with their
feet, press out the precious juice;
after which the husks and stalks are
collected in a head, and pressed with
the lever: this last pressing produces
the strongest and choicest wine.
The best wine is produced on the
south side of the Island, and, when
first made, is as deep coloured as
Port: it ferments for about six weeks
after it is made. It is computed that
about twenty thousand pipes are
made annually, of which about two
thirds are exported, principally to
Great Britain, and British colonies,
and the remainder is consumed on the
Island.</p>

<p>There are many different descriptions
of grapes; the large sized, and
which is merely a table grape, and is
not made into wine, is about the size
of a muscle plum, and the bunches
are so large as sometimes to weigh
twenty pounds.</p>

<p>The wines shipped from Madeira,
are classed Tinta, or Madeira Burgundy,
Malmsey, Sersial, and simple
plain Madeira; the three first thirty
pounds per pipe dearer than the latter,
which is sixty pounds per pipe of
110 gallons, free on board. This
high price is occasioned by the want
of unanimity among the English merchants,
or indeed a want of good faith
towards each other, for they appear
occasionally to rouse from their lethargy,
meet at their consul's, and
agree to give only certain prices for
the wines at the press; but, immediately
after, each out-bids the other,
and the wine-jobber laughs in his
sleeve, and profits by their folly.&mdash;Were
a dozen of the principal wine
shippers to be unanimous, they might,
with ease, reduce the wines at the
press one third of the present exorbitant
prices, and could, of course,
make a similar reduction in the shipping
prices, when they would consequently
have larger orders: but what
can scarcely be credited is, that when
they had what they term a factorial
meeting to affix the shipping prices
for 1819, all but two of the sapient
assembly were for raising the price<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
8<i>l.</i> per pipe; and when these two
proved to a demonstration that such
conduct would only induce the wine-jobbers
to make a similar rise, and
merely add to their coffers, already
overflowing with the effect of the
merchants' past follies; the meeting
still deemed it necessary to adjourn
for a few days, before they would allow
themselves to be convinced.</p>

<p>No foreign wine is allowed to be
imported, not even a few dozen of
Port for private use, although it is the
production of the mother country:
this is being strict indeed, yet it is
justifiable, as a very few years since
a discovery was made of an attempt
to smuggle into the Island a number
of pipes of wine from the Islands of
Fayal and Tenneriffe; and had not
the most rigid methods been adopted,
the wine of Madeira would have lost
its reputation, as no one who imported
wine from thence could have been
certain of having it genuine: consequently
the wines were seized, and
the heads of the casks were knocked
out in the public marketplace, which
overflowed with the contents: the
boats that landed it were confiscated,
and the smuggler condemned to
transportation, or to pay to the crown,
in addition to losing the wine, twice
its amount.</p>

<p>The Island is well supplied with
good beef, mutton, poultry, and some
wild pidgeons, quails, partridges,
snipes, woodcocks, wild rabbits, &amp;c.
The Atlantic furnishes the Island
with abundance of excellent jew fish,
john dory, pike, mullet, hake, mackeral,
pilchards, turtle, cray fish, crabs,
shrimps, limpets, &amp;c. They have a
breed of small but handsome and
serviceable horses.</p>

<p>Most of the commercial characters
on the Island are English; and among
them are some respectable long established
houses, possessing considerable
capitals: there are about twenty
different firms, and as many families.
The total number of British subjects
in Madeira, including women, children,
clerks, and servants, amounts to
one hundred; but they are too haughty,
too jealous, and too envious of
of each other, to be very sociable.</p>

<h2>THE PROMPTER.</h2>

<p class="center">He does not work it right.</p>


<p>What a vulgar saying the Prompter
has selected for his text in this number!
Yet these vulgar sayings are
often full of good sense.</p>

<p>I knew a young man who left the
army with an invincible attachment
to gambling. He followed it closely
till he had lost most of his wages&mdash;he
then purchased a shop of goods,
mostly on credit&mdash;he had his nightly
frolics&mdash;<em>he kept it up</em>&mdash;he was a blood
of the first rate&mdash;his goods were soon
gone and not paid for&mdash;his creditors
began to cry <i>peccavi</i>&mdash;in fact, <em>he did
not work it right</em>. But his friends
helped him out of six scrapes, yea,
out of seven. At length necessity
broke his spirit&mdash;it tamed him&mdash;he
married, became a man of business,
recovered his lost credit&mdash;and now
<em>he works it right</em>.</p>

<p>I often say to myself, as I ride about
the country, what a pity it is our farmers
<em>do not work it right</em>. When I
see a man turn his cattle into the
street to run at large and waste their
dung, during a winter's day, I say
this man does not work it right. Ten
loads of good manure, at least, is
lost in a season by this slovenly practice&mdash;and
all for what? For nothing,
indeed, but to ruin a farm.</p>

<p>So when I see cattle, late in the
fall or early in the spring, rambling
in a meadow or mowing field, pouching
the soil and breaking the grass
roots, I say to myself, this man <em>does
not work it right</em>.</p>

<p>So when I see a barn yard with a
drain to it, I say the owner does not
work it right; for how easy it is to
make a yard hollow, or lowest in the
middle, to receive all the wash of the
sides, which will be thus kept dry for
the cattle. The wash of the yard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
mixed with any kind of earth, or putrid
straw, is the best manure in the
world&mdash;yet how much do our farmers
lose! In fact they do not work
it right.</p>

<p>When I pass along the road and
see a house with clapboards hanging
an end with one nail, and old hats
and cloths stuffed into the broken
windows, and the fences tumbling
down or destroyed, I conclude the
owner loves rum&mdash;in truth, he does
not work it right.</p>

<p>When I see a man frequently attending
courts, I suspect <em>he does not
work it right</em>.</p>

<p>When I see a countryman often go
to the retailer's with a bottle, or the
labouring man carrying home a bottle
of rum after his work is done on
Saturday night, I am certain this man
<em>does not work it right</em>.</p>

<p>When a farmer divides a farm of
one hundred acres of land among
five or six sons, and builds a small
house for each, and sets them to work
for a living on a little patch of land,
I question whether <em>he works it right</em>.
And when these sons are afterwards
unable to live on these mutilated
farms, and are compelled by a host of
children to go to work by the day to
get bread, I believe they are all convinced
that <em>they have not worked it
right</em>.</p>

<p>When a man tells me his wife will
not consent to go from home into
new settlements, where he may have
land enough, and live like a nabob,
and therefore he is obliged to sit down
in a corner of his father's farm, I
laugh at him, and some time or other
he will own <em>he has not worked it
right</em>.</p>

<p>A man in trade, who is not punctual
in his payments, certainly <em>does
not work it right</em>; nor does the man,
who trusts his goods to <em>any body</em>, and
<em>every body</em>.</p>

<p>Whether in Congress or a kitchen,
the person who <em>talks much</em> is <i>little
regarded</i>. Some members of Congress
then certainly <em>do not work it
right</em>. A hint to the <em>wise</em> is sufficient;
but twenty hints have not been
sufficient to silence the clamorous
tongues of some Congressional spouters.</p>

<p>Family government gives complexion
to the manners of a town: but
when we see, every where, children
profane, indelicate, rude, saucy, we
may depend on it, their <em>parents do
not work it right</em>.</p>

<p>I once knew a young man of excellent
hopes, who was deeply in love
with a lady. The first time he had
an opportunity to whisper in her ear;
and before he had made any impression
on her heart in his favour, he
sighed out his sorrowful tale to her
in full explanation. The lady was
frightened&mdash;she soon rid herself of
the distressed lover&mdash;she said, <em>he did
not work it right</em>.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE TURKS.</h2>


<p>In the New England Galaxy we
find the following account of the
Turks. If the facts are as stated,
those that are termed barbarians are
<em>Christians in practice</em>, while we who
are Christians by name, are barbarians
in reality.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding their religion differs
from ours, still I cannot help respecting
it. They worship the same
God that we do&mdash;they esteem our
Saviour as a great prophet and lawgiver&mdash;their
prayers are evidently offered
with a sincere heart, and considering
that it is the religion of their
ancestors, how can we blame them
for preferring it to ours? Did you
but know in what contempt they hold
a renegado, you would agree in opinion
with me, that the combined powers
of the whole Christian world would
not be able to persuade a virtuous
musselman to change his faith.</p>

<p>"Honesty, so often sought and rarely
found, among the enlightened and
religious communities of Europe and
America, in this part of Asia and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
the Turkish dominions west of the
Hellespont, stands unrivalled.</p>

<p>"Whether a sense of virtue or moral
obligations to each other contained
in the pages of the Koran is the
cause, I am unable to say; but all
travellers who have visited this country,
and are divested of prejudice,
will do them the justice to say, that
theft is a crime almost unknown
throughout the realms of the Grand
Seignor.</p>

<p>"A merchant of Smyrna having
occasion to send about five hundred
pound sterling a distance of about
four days journey into the country,
requested his brokers to find a suitable
person! The first they met in
the streets, although one of the lowest
porters, they engaged for that purpose.</p>

<p>"The gold was given him in a bag,
and without even inquiring his name
or residence in the city, he was directed
to hand it to the merchant in
the village, whose name was given
him on a piece of paper: and on his
return he should receive the amount
agreed on, and about five dollars as
a compensation for his trouble.</p>

<p>"On the eighth or ninth day he returned
to the city, stating that he had
delivered the money, when he received
his pay, and went to seek employment
in the streets.</p>

<p>"After a lapse of nearly a month,
a letter from the merchant announced
that he had not received the money,
and expressed surprise at the circumstance.
This excited considerable
alarm, particularly as it was almost
impossible to find the messenger,
having a second time neglected
to take his name. After three days
search, however, he was found staggering
through the streets with a
heavy burden on his back; and being
informed of the cause why they
sought him, he laid it down and exclaimed,
'God forbid that I should
wrong any man, even a <em>Christian!</em>
but,' he continued, 'I will go back
at my own expense and see who has
got the property; otherwise my reputation
will be ruined!' This speech
had a curious effect from a man whose
real and personal estate would not, in
all probability, have amounted to fifty
piastres.</p>

<p>"He departed, and arriving at the
village, examined, with a scrutinizing
eye, every Christian he met, till at
last the Greek to whom he had given
the gold, presented himself. 'You
have injured my reputation like a
dog, as you are, (said the porter,) and
have taken from me that which belongs
to another! but, thank God, you
are found at last; I will take you to
the Agha, and have you hung, that
the world may be rid of such a scoundrel.'
The Greek on his knees begged
forgiveness: 'I was in distress,
(he said) when I saw you, and having
occasion for the money, I assumed
the name of my neighbour! It
was my intention to have paid him
before he would feel any alarm as to
the remittance: but spare my character;
here is your gold, and here
are 500 piastres for yourself!' The
Turk allowed him to depart, took
the money to the right owner, and
returned with his pockets better filled
than they had ever been during the
whole course of his life.</p>

<p>"The perfect resignation with
which the Turks submit to the dispensations
of Providence cannot but
be pleasing to every one. If they
are fortunate, God is praised; if the
reverse, they say, 'His will be done.'</p>

<p>"The Turk never effects insurance
on his commercial adventures;
but often, previous to despatching his
vessel, makes a solemn promise, that,
should he be fortunate, a sum of money
shall be bestowed in charity;
which promise is never broken. But,
should she be lost, and, as often happens,
his whole property with her, he
exclaims, 'God's will be done,' and
seeks in the streets the means of accumulating
another, in the laborious
employment of a porter.</p>

<p>"His friends continue to show him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
the respect he previously experienced,
remarking, 'Our brother has
been unfortunate, but it was the will
of God! Why should we treat him
otherwise? We are all liable to lose
our possessions, and it would be censuring
the decrees of the Almighty,
were we to neglect him!' How can
we but admire these principles, notwithstanding
they emanate from the
breasts of those differing from us in
religious tenets?"</p>

<p><i>Benevolence the source of delight.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Benevolus</span>,
who was uncommonly
fond of music, was dressing to go to
an opera, which was much admired,
when he heard a murmuring of voices
in the passage below his chambers;
on inquiry, he was told that it was occasioned
by a workman who had
dropped half a guinea that he had
just received for his week's wages,
which could not be found; and on
which his own maintenance and that
of his wife and child depended. It
immediately struck Benevolus that he
could afford to give the man the half
guinea by staying from the opera that
night. He accordingly sent him the
money and staid at home.</p>

<p>On another occasion, Benevolus
having been prevailed on to promise
to dine at a tavern with some young
men, of whose company he was fond,
was solicited for charity at the tavern
door by a woman with an infant suckling
at each of her breasts, and two
half-naked children following her.&mdash;"For
heaven's sake, a penny," said
the poor woman, "to purchase some
bread." "We are very hungry,"
cried the children. Benevolus, thrusting
his hand in his pocket, found he
had just a guinea, and no other money
of any kind. "Good heaven!"
thought he, "I am going to throw
away the greatest part of this for a
dinner, and it will maintain this poor
woman and children a fortnight!"&mdash;He
slipped the guinea into the poor
woman's hand, and, returning directly
to his chamber, sent an apology to
the company, and dined with more
delight on a mutton-chop than he had
ever experienced from the most luxurious
dinner.</p>

<p><i>Home.</i>&mdash;The great end of prudence,
Dr. Johnson says, is to give
cheerfulness to those hours which
splendour cannot gild, and acclamation
cannot exhilarate. Those soft
intervals of unbended amusement, in
which a man shrinks to his natural dimensions,
and throws aside the ornaments
and disguises which he feels in
privacy to be useless incumbrances,
and to lose all effect when they become
familiar. To be happy at <em>home</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
is the ultimate result of all ambition,
the end to which every enterprise and
labour tends, and of which every design
prompts the prosecution. It is,
indeed, at home, that every man must
be known, by those who would make
a just estimate either of his virtue or
felicity; for smiles and embroidery
are alike occasional, and the mind is
often dressed for show in painted honour
and fictitious benevolence.</p>

<p>There is something undoubtedly
venerable in antiquity, but even this
passion may be carried beyond its
proper bounds. An old gentleman
was once possessed of a jack-knife,
which he declared he would not sell
for twenty dollars. It was once, said
he, the property of my great grandfather&mdash;and
since I have been the
owner of the knife, it has been repaired
with four blades and two
handles.</p>

<p><i>The Emperor of Morocco.</i>&mdash;The
following anecdote serves to show the
<em>high wisdom</em> of the Emperor of Morocco:&mdash;A
Jew had ordered a French
merchant to furnish him with a considerable
quantity of black beaver
hats, green shawls, and red silk stockings.
When the articles were ready
for delivery, the Jew refused to receive
them. Being brought before
the emperor, who, it is well known,
administers justice himself, he denied
having given the order, and maintained
that he did not know the French merchant.
"Have you any witnesses?"
said the emperor to the Frenchman.
"No." "So much the worse for
you; you should have taken care to
have had witnesses&mdash;you may retire."
The poor merchant, completely ruined,
returned home in despair. He
was, however, soon alarmed by a noise
in the street; he ran to see what it
was. A numerous multitude were
following one of the emperor's officers,
who was making the following
proclamation at all the cross roads:
"Every Jew, who within 24 hours
after this proclamation, shall be found
in the streets without a black beaver
hat on his head, a green shawl round
his neck, and red silk stockings on his
legs, shall be immediately seized, and
conveyed to the first Court or Palace,
to be there flogged to death." The
children of Israel all thronged to the
French merchant, and before evening
the articles were all purchased at
any price he chose to demand for
them.</p>

<p><i>A knave outwitted.</i>&mdash;A man lately
came into a merchant's store in Newbern,
N. C. and told the merchant
he owed him five dollars for goods he
lately had of him. The merchant
being a correct man in his business,
finding no charge against him on
book, and knowing also that he never
gave credit to strangers, told the honest
man he must be mistaken; but
he insisted he was not, and paid the
money. A few days afterwards he
called again and wanted credit for
goods to the amount of about $30,
which the merchant declined letting
him have. The man pretended to
be surprised that he, who had shown
such honesty in paying a debt, which
the merchant had forgotten, should be
refused a further credit; but says the
merchant, if I have been foolish
enough, for once to trust a stranger,
I shall not be such a fool again.</p>

<p><i>Mineralogy.</i>&mdash;The science of mineralogy
is at present pursued with
uncommon assiduity in England.&mdash;The
elementary treatises on the subject,
as published there, are numerous,
but lately Mr. Philips published
a second edition of a Manual of
Mineralogy, of which in 9 months he
sold 900 copies. In Paris there are
four lectures on the subject, and last
year the only four students who were
foreigners, were all from Pennsylvania&mdash;these
were the young Messrs.
Gallatin, Seybert, Keating, and Vancexin.
The science seems to be
highly deserving of encouragement
here, as it has become reduced to
such general rules as enables the
mineralist or geologist to ascertain
with tolerable certainty what substances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
are, and what are not to be found
in the bowels of different parts of the
earth, by inspection of its surface, as
well as to ascertain by sight, or by
analysis, their nature, composition,
properties, and uses.</p>

<p><i>Cave in Virginia</i>.&mdash;Of <em>Wier's Cave</em>
in Virginia, general C. Jones, of that
state, has lately given a description,
of which the following is a summary.
The cave is of limestone, generally
descending in its course. The entrance,
about 4 feet square, brings
you first into a room 12 or 15 feet
high; you then creep along a narrow
passage into another room&mdash;then, descending
a ladder, you enter <em>Solomon's
temple</em>, in which is a large fluted
column, called <em>Solomon's pillar</em>,
and on the sides curtains descend
from the ceiling to the floor, the
room about 25 feet high; ascending
a ladder, you pass a steep narrow
rock, and then descend into the <em>curtain
room</em>, profusely ornamented with
drapery, having more of the appearance
of art than of chance, the curtains
hanging from 6 to 12 inches
apart, and mostly white and transparent:&mdash;next
is the <em>music room</em>,
abounding with stalactites similar to
those forming the curtains just mentioned,
but of firm texture, on which
enchanting music can be made, when
struck with a skilful hand:&mdash;You
next descend a natural staircase, with
something like balusters on one side,
and then, down a ladder, into the <em>ballroom</em>,
100 feet long, and from 16 to
20 high, the floor smooth, the sides
ornamented with curtains, and in
which there is a sofa, remarkable for
its resemblance to the reality. You
next encounter a long difficult narrow
passage, creeping and sliding part of
the way, and then, descending some
steps, you enter the <em>vestibule</em>, the
arch about 25 feet high, in which is a
saloon, and Mary's gallery, the latter
formed of a horizontal sheet of rock,
a foot thick, and 20 in diameter:&mdash;You
then enter <em>Washington-Hall</em>, the
grandest part of the cavern, the floor
of which is level, and rings to the
tread, the arch above 80 feet high,
and on one side is something like a
a row of marble statuary:&mdash;The next
is <em>Lady Washington's drawing room</em>,
a handsome large apartment, with
something like a bureau in it, on
which are inscribed a number of
names:&mdash;The <em>diamond room</em> is next,
its walls sparkling with brilliants;
then the <em>enchanted room</em>, in which is
a basin containing about two hogsheads
of pure water, and a column,
about 25 feet in diameter, called the
tower of Babel; and the last is the
<em>Garden of Eden</em>. This is a spacious
apartment, in which a rock seems to
be floating over head, called Elijah's
mantle, and a large white curtain,
and a rock called the salt mountain,
are seen at a distance. The general,
and the party with him, were two
hours and three quarters before they
regained the mouth of the cavern.</p>

<p><i>Missouri.</i>&mdash;The Missouri Convention,
having completed its labours in
the formation of a constitution for
that state, have designated St. Louis
as the seat of government for the
state until 1827, when it is to be permanently
established on the Missouri,
at or near the mouth of the Osage,
which place is to be called Missouriopolis,
the former part of the name
being Indian, and the latter Grecian.</p>

<p><i>Iron Rail or Carriage-ways.</i>&mdash;In
the neighbourhood of Newcastle, this
ingenious mode of reducing friction,
and facilitating the conveyance of
loaded wagons, has been adopted to a
very great extent. According to M.
Gallois, an extent of 28 square miles
on the surface of the earth, presents
a series of 75 miles for this species
of conveyance; while the interior of
the adjacent coal mines contains them
to as large an amount. Five or six
wagons, made entirely of iron, fastened
to each other in regular succession,
descend these roads without any
other mover than their own gravitating
force. By means of a pulley, or
wheel, a certain number of carriages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
in descending occasion a certain number
of others to mount, in order to
take in a load at the summit of the
inclined plane they traverse. We
are, however, naturally led to believe
that, excepting in very peculiar circumstances,
there will always be a
great saving of power in conveyances
by water, for this simple reason, that
the whole weight of the burden so
transported, is transported by the
stream with a comparatively small
loss of power by friction, while the
inclined plane, on which the carriage
runs, supports only a part of its
weight. On the other hand, however,
it cannot be denied that many situations
in which it would be quite impossible
to open a canal, might admit
of the establishment of metallic and
other rail-ways.</p>

<p><i>Varnish for Wood.</i>&mdash;The Italian
cabinet work, in this respect, excels
that of any other country. To produce
this effect, the workmen first
saturate the surface with olive oil,
and then apply a solution of gum
arabic in boiling alcohol. This mode
of varnishing is equally brilliant, if
not superiour, to that employed by
the French in their most elaborate
works.</p>

<p><i>American Saltpetre.</i>&mdash;A Boston paper
says&mdash;"We have seen a quantity
of Saltpetre refined and chrystallized
at the Gunpowder Manufactory of
Chelmsford, which, for whiteness and
clearness, was much superiour to that
of foreign preparations, with which it
was compared; and we understand it
can be afforded at a less price. The
chrystallization of the American articles
is uncommonly handsome, and
will gratify the attention of any who
may view it."</p>

<p><i>The Horse.</i>&mdash;J. Carver, Veterinary
Surgeon, has written a letter to the
editor of the Plough Boy, wherein
he stated he had been applied to by a
gentleman to cut the Lampas out of
his horse's mouth, but that he had declined
on the ground that there was
no necessity for such an operation;
and that the disorder could be cured
in the following simple manner:&mdash;"Rub
the upper part of the roof of
the mouth, which you find on those
occasions red and swollen, with coarse
salt, three or four times a day&mdash;throw
in his manger also a few ears of
the hardest corn; and thus, a few
days would totally remedy the evil."</p>

<p>Mr. Carver expresses some astonishment
that persons "should fall
into the ridiculous and absurd belief,
that horses are subject to that imaginary
disease called Lampas. Because,
examining the palate or roof
of the mouth would be quite sufficient
to convince a judicious investigator,
that the supposed enlargement
cannot deprive the animal of his food;
since it is not in the least sore, nor
shows any signs of sensibility on pressure."</p>

<p>He states that the error proceeds
from a want of the knowledge of the
animal, and the obstinacy and ignorance
of stabularian philosophers;
that the operation of "<em>cutting and
burning</em> the palate with a red hot
iron, not only prevents the animal
from eating his food for some weeks,
but is frequently attended with the
most serious consequences by opening
the palatine artery, which has
bled many a horse to death for want
of proper assistance."</p>

<p>Mr. Carver advises gentlemen never
to suffer the operation to be performed,
but if the parts are very red
and very much swollen, they may be
just scarified with the point of a sharp
penknife, or pricked with a large
darning needle. He concludes with
saying, "that the cutting and raising
the frog from the ground to keep the
foot in health&mdash;the cutting out the
haw of the eye, to cure inflammation
and lockjaw&mdash;and the operation of
burning for Lampas, can by no means
be reconciled to common sense."</p>

<p><i>Internal Wealth.</i>&mdash;A correspondent
informs us, that he passed, in
Danvers, on Wednesday last, a wagon
road of merino wool, weighing three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
tons, drawn by seven horses, passing
from Hanover, N. H. (where it was
produced,) to the Factory at Danvers&mdash;the
value of which was probably
from four to six thousand dollars.</p>

<p><i>New Hampshire State Prison.</i>&mdash;The
income of this penitentiary, for
the last year, has been derived from
the usual sources, the labour of convicts
in its various departments, the
sale of articles manufactured by them,
and the fees of admittance to visiters&mdash;the
whole amounts to $4660 81 cts.
The expenditures during the same
period, amount to $4203 53 cts. leaving
a balance gained to the institution
during the last year of $457.28. The
amount of property on hand has also
increased $1811.41; and the balance of
debts due, $743.14; making the whole
income $2553.55; from which deducting
the amount received from
the treasury, leaves a balance further
gained of $454.55. In the amount
of debts due is included $3637.03,
charged to the state house committee,
for labour of the convicts in preparing
stone, &amp;c. for that building; which,
if paid over to the state prison, would
reduce the sum required from the
treasury to meet the estimated expenses
of the present year to $963.</p>

<p><i>Anecdote of Lycurgus.</i>&mdash;Lycurgus,
the Spartan lawgiver, to show his
countrymen the vast importance of
education, by reason of its influence
in forming the minds and manners of
a people, caused two whelps of the
same litter to be bred in quite different
ways; whereby the one became
sluggish and ravenous, the other of
a good scent, and skilled in hunting.
Finding the experiment to answer
his design, he soon took an occasion
at an assembly of the Lacedemonians
to discourse on this subject, and address
them in the following manner:</p>

<p>"It is of great advantage, fellow
citizens, to the acquirement of virtue,
when any one is trained up in the
customary practice of wholesome instructions,
and precept, which I will
presently let you see by example."&mdash;On
this, he ordered the young dogs
to be brought into the midst of the
hall, where was set before them a
vessel, in which meat had been frequently
boiled, and a <em>live hare</em>.&mdash;Whereupon,
according to their different
breeding, one flew to the hare,
and the other as greedily ran to the
vessel.</p>

<p>The spectators were surprised:
and, as they were musing what should
be the intent of his introducing the
whelps after this manner, he said to
them, "This is what I before told
you; you perceive these creatures do
as they were taught, for, though they
are both of a litter, yet the diversity
of breeding has made one a good
hound, and the other a cur, good for
nothing but to lick pots and dishes."</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
